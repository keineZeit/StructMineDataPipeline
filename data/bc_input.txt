The central question is where should the Plaintiffs \ ' claims be tried , in England , as the Plaintiffs contend , or in Spain , as the Defendants contend .
The Parties : The Kuwait Investment Office -LCB- \ ` KIO \ ' -RRB- is a branch of the Kuwait Investment Authority established in Kuwait and has as its function the management of investment of funds belonging to the Government of Kuwait .
KIO is based in London .
Grupo Torras is incorporated in Spain and is indirectly controlled by KIO .
He was served with the proceedings under RSC Order 11 in the Bahamas ; but the Judge held that he was domiciled in England and could have been served in England .
Messrs de la Rosa , Soler , Nunez , de Mir and Pique were together referred to as the \ ` Spanish Defendants \ ' , being domiciled in Spain .
Mr Robinson , Mr Jaffar and Mr Moukarzel were domiciled in England .
Mr Jaffar was Deputy Chairman and General Manager of KIO until 20 April 1990 , a director of Koolmees and Kokmeeuw until 15 March 1990 , and at all material times Vice-President and a director of Grupo Torras .
Mr Coll is an accountant of British nationality who lives in Spain .
Mr Russell is also an accountant ; he lives in Jersey and practices as a partner of Russell Limebeer .
Croesus International Ltd and Wantley Developments Ltd are Gibraltar companies provided by Mr Coll .
Wardbase Developments Ltd -LRB- an English company -RRB- , Oakthorn Ltd -LRB- a Jersey company -RRB- , Westow Ltd and Anslow Ltd -LRB- both Isle of Man companies -RRB- , were provided by or associated with Mr. Russell .
Croesus : In May 1988 Us $ 27.4 million at the request of Mr de la Rosa and Mr Jaffar was transferred by KIO to Grupo Torras .
In September 1989 , Banco Santander , at the request of Torras London , transferred US $ 25 million to Kokmeeuw in \ ` partial repayment \ ' of the transfer of US $ 27.4 million to the Republic National Bank .
It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions , notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus , with extensions , a guarantee of the \ ` loan \ ' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras .
Of the US $ 55 million , $ 7.5 million is said to have been traced to an account in Mr Jaffar \ 's name in a Bank in Zurich ; smaller sums to companies associated with Mr Russell .
As to the US $ 50 million , $ 10 million is said to have been traced to Mr Jaffar \ 's Zurich Bank , $ 22.5 million to an account controlled by Sheikh Fahad in a bank in London and $ 15.49 million to the account of a company in Jersey of which Mr Russell is a signatory and whose address is the same as Russell Limebeer .
Pincinco : Under a Fiduciary Agreement dated 2 October 1990 , Torras London through Banco Santander -LRB- Suiza -RRB- SA deposited US $ 300 million with Bankers Trust AG , Geneva and the latter agreed for a fee/commission of $ 2.1 million to make , and did an 3 October 1990 make , a loan of US $ 300 million to Pincinco at Torras London \ 's risk and expense .
Pincinco is a Jersey company now in liquidation of which Mr Russell was company secretary and now a liquidator .
The US $ 300 million was not intended to be repaid by Pincinco from its own funds and was not paid to Pincinco for the benefit of Grupo Torras or Torras London .
2 billion was transferred by Grupo Torras to Torras London in Barcelona and then by Torras London to an account in the name of Wardbase in London .
We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried : -LRB- See Seaconsar v. Bank Markasi -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 438 at p. 455 , where Lord Goff of Chieveley indicated that the issue of the merits should net be debated at length -RRB- .
The Defendants argued that , for the purposes of Article 21 , the parties to these Spanish criminal proceedings included Sheikh Fahad and messrs Jaffar , de la Rosa , de Mir , Nunez , Folchi and Soler .
On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa , de Mir , Nunez , Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to -LRB- among other things -RRB- the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action .
Thus it was argued that England was not an appropriate forum and that Spain was the appropriate forum .
Chronology As previously stated , the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized , it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions , this action in England and the criminal , guerelJa , proceedings and the Quail action in Spain .
9/6/92 Original Quail proceedings filed 26/1/33 Judge Moreiras orders the no-admission of the criminal proceedings on the application of Mr de la Rosa -RRB- 19/2/33 Judge Moreiras confirms non-admission of the criminal proceedings -LRB- `` after further intervention by Sheikh Fahad and Mr Jaffar 14/4/93 English writ issued 15/4/93 English writ served within jurisdiction on Jaffar , Robinson , Moukarzel , Coll & Co. and Wardbase 7/5/33 Missing documentation lodged by Quail in original Quail proceedings 12/5/33 Original Quail proceedings admitted 17-8/5 / 93 English writ served on Anslow , Westow , Croesus , Wantley , Russell , Limebeer and Oakthorn 1P/5/93 Quail proceedings amended by adding de la Rosa , de Mir , Nunez , Folchi and Soler 21/5/93 -15 / 6/93 English writ served on Russell , Sheikh Fahad , Riquel and Coggia 18/6/93 Amended Quail proceedings admitted 21/6/93 English writ served on de la Rosa , de Mir , Soler , Coll and Folchi 3/7/93 Criminal proceedings again not admitted 1/10/93 Amended Quail proceedings served on Grupo Torras 1/10/93 English writ served on Pique 15/11/93 English writ served on Nunez 11/2/34 Audiencia National orders that the criminal proceedings be admitted -LSB- 29/4/34 Judge Foncillas stays the Quail proceedings pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings -RSB- The Expert Evidence of Spanish Law : A vast amount of evidence of Spanish law was adduced before the Judge .
However , where the evidence of an expert witness on foreign law is not contradicted , the Judge should be reluctant to reject it : -LRB- Sharif v Azad -LSB- 1967 -RSB- 1 QB 605 per Diplock LJ at p. 616B -RRB- .
But it should be extremely reluctant to substitute its own views where questions of credibility are concerned , since the Judge has had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses : -LRB- Parkasho v Singh -LSB- 1968 -RSB- P 233 at p. 250 ; Dalmia Dairy Industries Ltd v National Bank of Pakistan -LSB- 1978 -RSB- 2 Lloyds 233 per Megaw LJ at p. 286 -RRB- .
It is accepted that his reason under -LRB- iv -RRB- can not stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras , Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa , de Mir , Nunez , Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies .
That case concerned the carriage on the vessel , the `` Tatry '' , of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated , it was said , by diesel oil .
Although it is accepted that the reasoning of Mance J can not , as such , stand with the judgment of the Court in Maciej Rataj , the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would , if accepted , lead to the same conclusion .
The Application of Article 21 , the Quail Action : For the purposes of Article 21 , the proceedings which are relevant are , in England , the present action and , in Spain , the \ ` Quail \ ' proceedings .
After the amendment of the Quail action , the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa , de Mir , Nunez , Folchi and Soler .
The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez , in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted .
It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993 , that is to say , a date after the date upon which the English court had , on any view , became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties , which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them .
Accordingly the ground of appeal which was founded on the submission that as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs , other than Mr. Nunez , that is to say , de la Rosa , de Mir , Folchi and Soler , the Spanish court was the first seized , fails .
The facts in that case , either proved or assumed , were as follows : Macmillan -LRB- the 11th defendants in one of the present actions -RRB- were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc , a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family ; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz ; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan \ 's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust , who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family ; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family .
As commonly happens the contracts were arranged in layers : first there was a contract with a limit of \ xc2 \ xa31 million , subscribed by New Hampshire Insurance Company alone ; above that there were a succession of layers up to the following totals - 1988/1989 \ xc2 \ xa325 million 1989/1990 \ xc2 \ xa335 million 1990/1991 \ xc2 \ xa350 million 1991/1992 \ xc2 \ xa350 million New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts , except for the top \ xc2 \ xa310 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992 , which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA .
As has already been mentioned , in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public ; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone .
In relation to that year Mr Ward of the Risk Management Department said this in his statement : \ t \ tTo the best of my knowledge I did not receive a copy of the Chubb excess layer wording for the subsequent policy year , namely , July 1991/June 1992 .
However , we were shown a letter dated 16th January 1991 , to New Hampshire from Miss Godwin of the policy division at Willis Wrightson .
We can not attribute much , or indeed any , weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote `` checked & okay '' on the letter , and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept ; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb , since they did not know of them .
Mr Phillips in the course of his reply pointed out that it was and remains the pleaded case of the Claimants that the Chubb policy did form part of the contracts .
How then were they allowed to procure a preliminary issue from Waller J. , and to argue before Potter J. that the Chubb policy did not form part of the contracts .
The slips for Chubb in Year 3 and Year 4 had the same description of the insured , with very slight and immaterial variations , as the New Hampshire policies for those years .
We feel that we are relieved from the need to answer those questions by the authority of the House of Lords , in the passage already quoted from P. Samuel & Co Ltd v Dumas .

JUSTICE NEUBERGER : INTRODUCTION This is an application by Mr Holland , the liquidator of Harvard Securities Limited -LRB- `` Harvard '' -RRB- , for directions under Section 112 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in relation to certain shares in Australian and United States companies held by Harvard .
\ r \ n Between 1980 and 1986 Harvard purchased shares in various Australian and US companies -LRB- `` the Australian shares '' and `` the US shares '' respectively -RRB- and sold them on to clients .
\ r \ n When Harvard purchased a block of Australian or US shares with a view to selling them on to clients in parcels of shares , it was its practice not to register each of the parcel of shares in the name of the relevant client .
In these circumstances , I think the right basis upon which I should proceed is to assume that such communications as I have seen passing between Harvard and its clients relating to the acquisition , sale and holding of the Australian and US shares are typical , and indeed representative , of such communications passing between Harvard and its clients .
Since 1986 , all the Australian shares have been held in the name of ANZ Nominees -LRB- `` ANZ '' -RRB- , a subsidiary of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited , and the share certificates have always been held in Melbourne , Australia .
ANZ accepts that , as against Harvard , it is no more than a mere nominee for Harvard ; ANZ has agreed to be bound by any order which the court makes in these proceedings .
The sale would be recorded by Harvard by way of book entry , and the share certificate , in respect of the whole block of shares , would remain in the name and physical possession of ANZ in Australia .
They are registered in the name of the English Association of American Bond and Shareholders Limited -LRB- `` the Association '' -RRB- , which accepts that it is a mere nominee for Harvard ; like ANZ in relation to the Australian shares , the Association agrees to be bound by whatever decision the court makes in these proceedings .
The share certificates for the US shares were held in London by a bank to Harvard \ 's order , and are now held at the liquidator \ 's London offices .
On occasion , Harvard wrote to clients `` regarding your purchase of -LSB- certain US -RSB- shares '' and stated that `` in order to save on transaction costs these shares are being held to your order under a nominee name '' .
Harvard similarly wrote to clients referring to the US shares as `` your shares '' .
\ r \ n Harvard \ 's internal records in relation to the US shares were very similar to that relating to the Australian shares .
In these proceedings , the liquidator seeks the determination of the court as to whether Harvard or the former clients of Harvard has the beneficial interest in the Australian shares and the US shares .
Harvard has sufficient US shares and Australian shares to account to all its former clients in respect of their beneficial interests -LRB- if any -RRB- in such shares .
I proceed on the assumption that each of the Australian and US companies maintained their share register respectively in Australia and the United States .
Accordingly , -LRB- subject to there being any choice of law clause -RRB- , in light of the observations I have quoted from Macmillan , it seems to me that the issue of the beneficial ownership of those shares is to be determined by Australian law : they are registered shares in a company registered in Australia and the share register is , I presume , in Australia .
Further , although probably irrelevant in light of Macmillan , the share certificates are physically in Australia .
Accordingly , I conclude that the US shares are negotiable in equity , and , following the majority view in Macmillan , any question concerning equitable interests in the shares is governed by English law , subject again to any choice of law clause .
At 142 line 45 to 143 line 3 , Oliver said that the observation -LRB- of Sir John Romilly MR in Pooley - v - Budd -LRB- 1851 -RRB- 14 Beav 34 -RRB- `` that a trust was created of unascertained goods '' could not `` stand today in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re Waif .
\ r \ n I now turn to Re Goldcorp Exchange Limited -LRB- in Receivership -RRB- -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 AC 74 , a decision of the Privy Council allowing an appeal from the Court of Appeal in New Zealand .
\ r \ n After the decision in Goldcorp had been given , the House of Lords refused the defendant in Hunter leave to appeal : see at -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 614 .
\ r \ n CONCLUSIONS ON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN ENGLISH LAW On behalf of the liquidator , Mr Halpern , to whose argument I am much indebted , suggests that I should hold that the former clients of Harvard have no beneficial interest in the shares in English law , in light of the decision and reasoning in Wait , London Wine , and Goldcorp .
At page 61 of the current , Fifteenth , Edition of Underhill and Hayton `` Law of Trusts and Trustees '' there is strong adverse criticism of the decision and reasoning in Hunter .
In addition , as Mr Halpern points out , the reliance by Dillon LJ on the decision in Re Rose appears to overlook the fact that , in the relevant document , Mr Rose had specifically identified the shares which were intended to be the subject matter of the gift -LRB- see towards the bottom of page 500 -RRB- .
Underhill and Hay ton conclude their discussion as follows : \ r \ n `` In view of the weak reasoning in Hunter - v - Moss and of the ringing endorsement in Re London Wine Shippers Limited by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Limited .
\ r \ n As to Hunter being per incuriam , Mr Halpern argues that it is inconsistent with the reasoning in London Wine and Wait .
London Wine is a decision of a lower court , and in any event it was expressly considered and distinguished by the Court of Appeal in Hunter .
On the other hand , Wait was also a decision of the Court of Appeal , and was not expressly referred to , let alone distinguished , by the Court of Appeal in Hunter .
\ r \ n Equally , I do not consider that I can hold that Hunter is not binding on the basis that it has been effectively overruled by Goldcorp .
First , it appears to me that while the decision in Hunter is undoubtedly binding on me in principle , the decision in Goldcorp , being that of the Privy Council and not of the House of Lords , is not binding on me , and would not have been binding on the Court of Appeal in Hunter .
In my judgment , therefore , the ground upon which the Court of Appeal in Hunter distinguished London Wine is substantially the same ground upon which Goldcorp can be distinguished from Hunter .
Mr Halpern \ 's alternative argument was that Hunter could be properly distinguished from Wait , London Wine and Goldcorp on a ground on which the present case could be properly distinguished from Hunter , namely that Hunter was concerned with an express declaration of trust , whereas the other cases -LRB- including the present one -RRB- are not .
While it is true that this is a point mentioned by Dillon LJ when distinguishing London Wine -LRB- see at 458H -RRB- I have come to the conclusion that it is not a proper ground for distinguishing Hunter from Wait , London Wine and , indeed , Goldcorp and the present case .
Thirdly , in my view the suggested distinction between Hunter , on the one hand , and Wait and London Wine -LRB- and indeed Goldcorp -RRB- on the other hand is not logically defensible , a view clearly consistent with the general thrust of the observations to which I have referred in Underhill and Hay ton , and in Meagher Gummow & Lehane , referred to below .
-LRB- Indeed in the present case , I have already quoted from correspondence from Harvard to its clients in which Harvard described the holding of Australian and US shares , sold to the relevant client , as being held `` on your behalf '' and `` being your shares '' -RRB- .
First , that is a ground which is consistent with Dillon LJ \ 's reliance on Re Rose -LRB- a case concerned with shares -RRB- and his ground for distinguishing London Wine -LRB- and , by implication , Wait -RRB- which , it will be remembered , he described as being `` concerned with the appropriation of chattels and when property in chattels passes '' .
Secondly , it is on this basis that the editors of Underhill and Hayton believe that Hunter is explained -LRB- although they regard it on an unsatisfactory basis -RRB- .
The description of the sub-contracted grain in Wait , the client \ 's wine in London Wine , and the customer \ 's bullion in Goldcorp as `` an unascertained part of a mass of goods '' is quite apt .
\ r \ n In all the circumstances , therefore , it seems to me that the correct way for me , at first instance , to explain the difference between the result in Hunter , and that in Wait , London Wine and Goldcorp , is on the ground that Hunter was concerned with shares , as opposed to chattels .
Had the correspondence and internal records of Harvard gone one stage further , and identified the share numbers the subject of this arrangement , Mr Halpern accepts -LRB- quite rightly in my judgment -RRB- that the beneficial interest in the relevant shares would have been vested in the client .
\ r \ n BENEFICIAL INTERESTS : AUSTRALIAN LAW I have the benefit of a detailed report from Australian lawyers , Mallesons Stephen Jaques -LRB- `` Mallesons '' -RRB- which concludes that , on the facts I have recited , Harvard \ 's former clients would not , under Australian law , have an equitable interest in any of the Australian shares held by Harvard .
In those circumstances , Mallesons conclude that : \ r \ n `` In our view it is likely that courts of -LSB- Australia -RSB- would hold that Harvard \ 's former clients hold only contractual rig -RSB- is against Harvard and hold no equitable interest in the relevant securities held by -LSB- ANZ -RSB- .
\ r \ n CONCLUSIONS ON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS The US shares In light of the decision and reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Hunter , I conclude that Harvard \ 's former clients acquired the beneficial interest in the US shares which were sold to them , and held on their behalf by Harvard , and that those equitable interests are binding on the liquidators .
However , in relation to the US shares , and those Australian shares in which the former clients of Harvard have the beneficial interest , the position is a little more complicated .
However , as recent correspondence which I have seen demonstrates , and as indeed is borne out by Harvard \ 's reasons for holding the Australian shares in the name of ANZ and the US shares in the name of the Association , this would be a potentially expensive exercise .
\ r \ n In these circumstances , it seems to me that the sensible course to take is that suggested by Mr Halpern , namely to direct that the liquidator can sell the US shares and those Australian shares in which former clients of Harvard have a beneficial interest , and that he should then account to each former client out of the proceeds of sale of the relevant block of shares pro rata to that former client \ 's holding .
The main issue is whether former clients of Harvard have the beneficial interest in certain US shares and certain Australian shares sold to them , and held for them , by Harvard ; 2 .
Under English law , in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hunter , by which I am bound , the US shares and the Australian shares sold to former clients after 14th July 1986 , are held beneficially for Harvard \ 's former clients ; 5 .
As my previous judgment records , the second defendant -LRB- `` Royal Hotel '' -RRB- owns the Royal Hotel , a landmark on the water-front at St. Peter Port in Guernsey .
In the previous action , I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise .
The basis was that , following the fires , Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel \ 's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy , and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- Mr McHugh \ 's purpose and intention in giving the instruction was to manipulate Royal Hotel \ 's monthly and annual occupancy figures , trading turnover and profits for its 1991/1992 financial year so as to create a more favourable picture of its trading performance if and when it became either necessary or desirable to show management or audited annual accounts to one or other of Royal Hotel \ 's bankers , Republic National Bank of New York -LRB- Guernsey -RRB- -LRB- `` RNB '' -RRB- and TSB Bank -LRB- Channel Islands -RRB- -LRB- `` TSB '' -RRB- Limited .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- In compliance with Mr McHugh \ 's instructions , and as Mr McHugh knew and intended , in or about September 1991 Mr Anquetil produced three invoices in the name of Royal Hotel made out to Consolidator apparently showing accommodation at the hotel let to Consolidator for the months of July , August and September 1991 , although , as Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil each knew , no such accommodation as was shown in the invoices had been let to Consolidator .
As my previous judgment recounts , a similar course of events repeated itself when Mr McHugh instructed Mr Anquetil in or about March/April 1992 to address further invoices to BCS -LRB- another company controlled by Mr Slater whose family trust owns Consolidator -RRB- and when such invoices were in June 1992 created for the months March , April and May 1992 .
Following my judgment on 5th July 1996 , Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 5 -RRB- above .
-LRB- A -RRB- MATERIALITY It is clear that the knowledge and intentions of Mr McHugh as a director and company secretary of Royal Hotel regarding the matters summarized in -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 5 -RRB- are attributable to the Royal Hotel , and that ICCI and Royal Insurance were unaware of the matters when the material damage insurance was renewed in October 1991 .
They adduced evidence from Mr Jack Smith , a former underwriter and later manager with the Commercial Union , who was cross-examined by Miss Bucknall .
-LRB- per Lord Mustill at p.538C-D -RRB- In St. Paul at p. 124 the Court of Appeal also interpreted this definition as no different from , and to that extent as expressly approving , part of Steyn LJ \ 's formulation in the Court of Appeal in Pan Atlantic at -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 Ll.R .
The question is therefore whether ICCI and Royal Insurance have proved that Royal Hotel \ 's conduct through Mr McHugh was material to be known to a prudent underwriter when agreeing to renew the present material damage insurance .
Ms Bucknall cross-examined Mr Smith and Mr Walpole of ICCI by reference to the combined insurance proposal form disclosed by ICG , which could embrace hotel insurance and was itself based on a Royal Insurance form , as well as by reference to various standard forms of proposal which she put to him as being used by the Royal Insurance and other leading companies .
The following statement of the position was thus approved as correct by the Court of Appeal in St. Paul : `` The existence of such a presumption is recognized in the authorities : see Halsbury \ 's Laws of England vol .
In the present case the relevant hierarchy within ICCI consisted in 1991 of Mr Bray as commercial underwriting assistant , working in a team headed by the commercial controller Mrs Butler , above whom in seniority was Mr Peter Morris , the business manager , and then Mr Peter Walpole , the managing director .
Mr Bray also acted as part-time executive assistant to Mr Walpole .
Mr Morris has since May 1992 been managing director of Rossboroughs , brokers who acted for Royal Hotel in the placing of the present insurances and the presentation of claims under them .
His statement records that he met and discussed the matter with both Mr McHugh and Mr Walpole and Mr Bray in or after October 1996 .
No evidence was adduced that Mr Morris or Mr Butler would not in fact have been willing to attend court or to give oral evidence by video-link .
Since Mr Bray only had authority up to only \ xc2 \ xa32 million he would anyway have reported on the renewal to Mrs Butler or to Mr Morris direct .
Mr Morris \ 's underwriting authority was strictly limited to \ xc2 \ xa35 million , but in practice Mr Walpole allowed him flexibility and leeway .
Mr Bray had in April 1991 successfully taken the final set of Chartered Insurance Institute examinations for Associateship and was able to produce before me his copy of the CII textbook `` Property Insurance Risk Assessment and Control '' .
Although she did not attend for cross-examination , I also accept Mrs Butler \ 's written statement that she would have referred the matter on to Mr Morris , or to Mr Walpole in his absence .
In his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent `` would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy '' , that it `` would have raised the question of moral hazard and , as a matter of policy , it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action '' .
But I do not consider that Mr Walpole or Mr Morris would at the time have drawn any distinction between an unfulfilled but continuing intention to use dishonestly created accounting figures as and when necessary or desirable in relation to bankers and a situation where they had actually been so used .
Thirdly , Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine , sincere and honest .
This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement , where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him `` particularly in a recession -LRB- October 1991 -RRB- , when there was already growing concern about arson '' .
This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions , particularly in areas such as weather , to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county .
Fifthly , in December 1992 , during the course of events following the fires , insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater , the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group , but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground .
Apparently , the report recorded the inspectors \ ' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist `` was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders '' and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss .
The submission can not be accepted , even if attention is confined to dishonest conduct which , under the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales , requires a pleader to have `` before him reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case '' .
I heard evidence from Mr Martin Bakes of Herbert Smith , Mr Carter of Royal Insurance and Mr Walpole of ICO .
I held that up to and including this date insurers did not have full knowledge of the relevant circumstances ; that had been withheld from them by Royal Hotel ; the only representations that insurers could be treated as having made up to that stage were that they did not have full information or a full understanding of the position , that they were anxious to achieve this , that they had wanted to cross-examine Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh in the arbitration for that reason and that , once it became clear that those witnesses were not to be called , insurers were very likely to assert that there had been fraud to obtain benefit , in the absence of any satisfactory last minute explanation .
Herbert Smith \ 's letters dated 12th and 19th October 1993 gave Royal Hotel a last chance to put forward such an explanation .
In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS , which Royal Hotel \ 's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration -LRB- Mr Haberman -RRB- told insurers \ ' expert -LRB- Mr Lee -RRB- on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel \ 's accounts to `` massage '' the figures , though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why .
Mr Haberman \ 's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had `` ascertained '' by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and `` represent actual occupancy '' , but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that `` they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants '' .
It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents , that Price Waterhouse -LRB- in the person of Mr Lee -RRB- had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that , although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices , `` they are very similar , and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it '' .
Royal Hotel \ 's points of defence and counterclaim served 24th March 1994 pleaded -LRB- in what was then paragraph 18.17 -RRB- that Mr McHugh had in mid-June 1991 instructed Mr Anquetil to raise invoices to Consolidator in the sum of \ xc2 \ xa3150 ,000 at the rate of \ xc2 \ xa350 ,000 per month for the following three months , that during January to August 1991 the hotel had provided accommodation for contractors \ ' staff working on Havilland Hall and the hotel on behalf of Royal Hotel and other group companies and that `` The sum of \ xc2 \ xa3150 ,000 was a reasonable sum for this accommodation '' .
After letters from them and Sir Patrick , Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994 : '' Material Damage Award We are content that this should be dealt with in the manner proposed .
Sir Patrick thought it ambiguous whether they were concurring simply in a second interim award or also in its being in Royal Hotel \ 's favour , but Herbert Smith did not respond to his request of 18th October 1994 seeking this clarification .
Mr McHugh \ 's statement confirmed that the contractors \ ' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation -LRB- Ypres Guest House , Kingslynn and Fermoy -RRB- and other guest houses , and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices .
A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was , first , that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation , secondly , that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the `` fraud '' -LRB- i.e .
entered into , as Mr McHugh and , by him , Royal Hotel knew at the time of the transactions , to mislead Royal Hotel \ 's bankers as to the state of its balance sheer and/or -LRB- b -RRB- they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions , which in whole or in part did not represent any or any real occupancy of the hotel and/or did not represent occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel .
At the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action .
In the light of my judgment , insurers and Herbert Smith took independent expert advice on materiality , discussed materiality , inducement and the prospects of Royal Hotel establishing affirmation , decided to avoid the material damage insurance and on 12th August 1996 wrote accordingly .
On the evidence , Herbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims , as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters .
The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence , in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance .
Royal Insurance , which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI , thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and , as Mr Carter confirmed , to make judgments that required to be made during their course .
No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance .
Mr Bakes \ 's statement , which was adduced as his evidence in chief , described how a question-mark arose over the `` honesty '' of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel \ 's accounts in late June 1993 , Mr Lee \ 's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place `` in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel '' .
The gist of Mr Bakes \ ' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear ; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG ; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel , but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice ; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel \ 's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one .
Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins .
He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter , but could give no time or detail .
The phrase `` from that time as you know '' was explained by Mr Bakes as referring to his discussion with Mr Carter in early 1996 about Herbert Smith \ 's thinking in November 1994 .
He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994 , and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded -LRB- a -RRB- that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and -LRB- b -RRB- that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy , The affidavit continued : `` We decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action , in relation to the business interruption policy .
This was certainly Mr Carter \ 's attitude when , a year later , the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins .
I find not only that Herbert Smith believed and on strong grounds that there had been such dishonesty , but that they did for present purposes `` know '' the real position , however much Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out with implausible denials or evasions .
Mr Bakes was referred in re-examination to KPMG \ 's apparent continuing support of the Consolidator invoices and to Mrs Farnon \ 's statement dated 18th May 1995 basing this on representations from Mr McHugh , recorded , as Mr Bakes understood , in and on Consolidator \ 's letter dated 11th February 1993 .
This contrasts not only with a submission by Lord Irvine during the proceedings for summary judgment that paragraph 19 of Mr McHugh \ 's statement was a `` giveaway '' which caused Herbert Smith to put two and two together and led to the November 1995 pleading , but also with Mr Bakes \ 's subsequent statement in his witness statement that paragraph 19 `` reinforced my feeling that any deception might well have been intended to affect Royal Hotel \ 's bankers '' .
In reality , I consider , once the particulars had been reviewed in November 1994 , Herbert Smith was aware and for present purposes knew that the only purpose of the elaborate and palpably false invoices to Consolidator must have been to mislead and , in particular , to mislead persons such as bankers reviewing the hotel \ 's trading and that Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel must have caused them to be brought them into existence for that dishonest purpose .
Further , Herbert Smith \ 's letter dated 12th October 1994 involved a recognition of the validity of Sir Patrick Neill \ 's first award under the material damage policy , of his continuing jurisdiction and so by necessary implication of the continuing validity of the material damage award , since his jurisdiction was predicated on liability being admitted -LRB- as insurers themselves had successfully persuaded him in February 1994 , with the result that no actual business interruption award was ever issued -RRB- .
It seems unlikely -LRB- although Mr Bakes was not asked by either side about this -RRB- that it was simply coincidence that after the November 1994 particulars Herbert Smith failed to respond to Sir Patrick \ 's requests for clarification of their position on a second interim award on costs .
Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out , it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached , namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel \ 's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers .
The primary basis for Miss Bucknall \ 's submission is the statement of principle by Wigram V-C in Henderson v. Henderson -LRB- 1843 -RRB- 3 Hare 100 , 114 : '' ... where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in , and of adjudication by , a court of competent jurisdiction , the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case , and will not -LRB- except under special circumstances -RRB- permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest , but which was not brought forward , only because they have , from negligence , inadvertence , or even accident , omitted part of their case .
v. A-G for Queensland -LSB- 1979 -RSB- AC 411 , 425G , this was again identified as the true basis for the wider jurisdiction , which the Privy Council there said `` ought only to be applied where the facts are such as to constitute an abuse : otherwise there is a danger of a party being shut out from bringing forward a genuine subject of litigation '' .
Valuable discussions of the nature and scope of the jurisdiction under both heads are found in other authorities cited in Chitty , such as Dallal v. Bank Mellat -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 Q.B .
It was argued in the 1991 action that JMB was precluded under the wider principle in Henderson v. Henderson from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action , since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings .
He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer , since : `` It would in my judgment be an unwarranted extension of the doctrine of Henderson v. Henderson , even if it were otherwise applicable , to apply it to a case where no cause of action existed at the relevant date but which might then have existed had JMB made the necessary demands on the plaintiffs .
That being so , the Privy Council applied Henderson v. Henderson in its wider aspect .
Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in Henderson v. Henderson and the words of the Privy Council in Brisbane C.C .
Tai Ping obtained facultative reinsurance of their line from among others GAN and Eagle Star .
Of these the third , GAN , and the sixth , Eagle Star , are also reinsurers of the leaders Tai Ping -LRB- and plaintiffs in the first action -RRB- .
Mr G R Purdon of GAB Robins , Taiwan , International Loss Adjusters , was instructed on behalf of the direct insurers .
Mr D A Robbins of Dr JH Burgoyne and Partners Limited , Singapore , consulting scientists and engineers , was instructed by GAB Robins to investigate the fire aspects on behalf of the direct insurers .
The above is a standard London Market Claims Co-Operation Clause reference SCOR -LRB- UK -RRB- Clause 012 4/83 .
Whatever the governing law of the reinsurance contract as a whole , the Taiwan Insurance Law as interpreted in Taiwan governs questions of avoidance of the reinsurance contract for misrepresentation .
They may affect the way in which a provision incorporated from the original insurance into the reinsurance falls to be construed so as to give rise to `` back-to-back '' coverage , but they do not affect or purport expressly or implicitly to affect the law by which the contract is governed : Pine Top v Unione Italiana -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 476 , Vesta v Butcher -LSB- 1989 -RSB- AC 852 , Arig Insurance v SASA Assicurazione -LRB- unreported -RRB- 10.2.98 , Tuckey J .
The central administration of the plaintiffs in the first action and of four of the plaintiffs in the second action is in England -LRB- there is an issue as to whether General Accident \ 's central administration is in England or Scotland -RRB- .
\ t The words `` as original '' in the Tai Ping Slip and the words `` The Reinsurance is subject in all respects to the same clauses and conditions as original '' in the Central Slip were intended to ensure that the risk undertaken by reinsurers was identical as to period , geographical limits and nature of the risk , with the risk undertaken by Tai Ping/Central as direct insurers : see Pine Top v Unione Italiana -LRB- supra -RRB- Gatehouse J ; Vesta v Butcher -LRB- supra -RRB- p 875A , Neill LJ ; and Arig Insurance v SASA Assicuriazione -LRB- supra -RRB- , Tuckey J .
Also in this connection there should be noted a passage in the speech of Lord Griffiths in Vesta v Butcher at page 896C-E .
Negative Declarations \ t Mr Lockey for Tai Ping submitted as follows : \ t `` Claims for declarations , and in particular negative declarations , must be viewed with great caution in all situations involving possible conflicts of jurisdictions , since they obviously lend themselves to improper attempts at forum shopping '' : The Volvox Hollandia -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 2 Lloyd \ 's Rep 361 , at 371 , Kerr LJ ; First National Bank of Boston v Union Bank of Switzerland -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 32 at 38 , Sir Michael Kerr .
Akai v People \ 's Insurance Co -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 90 , 106 col 2 .
\ t \ tWhere leave to serve out of the jurisdiction a writ claiming a negative declaration is challenged , the Court will have to consider both the question whether there is justification for seeking that relief and the separate question of whether England is the appropriate forum in which to seek it .
-LRB- b -RRB- Generally \ t As issues relating to avoidance and the claims co-operation clauses fall to be determined according to English law , there is a strong case for saying that England is the natural and appropriate forum in which to resolve these issues : see New Hampshire v Phillips Electronics -LRB- supra -RRB- at 14G , where Phillips LJ said : \ t \ t `` As the issues of construction fall to be determined according to English law , I consider that England was the natural and appropriate forum in which to seek to resolve those issues .
\ t As to issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- in the second action , the alleged representation is contained in a fax dated 13 February 1996 from Alexander & Alexander -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- Ltd to Mr Gell , AHG -- London which stated : \ t \ t `` The following are the answers to your questions ... \ t \ tD -RRB- \ tThis project has installed a very good Fire Protection system which includes below six fire protections in every floor .
Mr Steven Lowe , a partner in Stephenson Harwood , solicitors for Tai Ping , states at paragraph 13 of his affidavit : \ t \ t '' ... : I am informed by Mr Su Ming-Teh of the Taipei Fire Fighting Equipment Association -LRB- an expert in fire fighting engineering -RRB- that foam water and fog water systems are only used in wafer plants in a very limited capacity , the main fire fighting systems employed in water plants being sprinklers , hydrants and hand held extinguishers , and that the drawings do show that there was a foam water and a fog water system , but not on floor 4 of FAB III where the fire occurred .
The General Notes refer to NFPA 13 standards which envisage sprinklers in the voids , but these apply in the United States and have no statutory or regulatory effect in Taiwan , and the detailed drawings , which show no sprinkler system in the ceiling voids , would obviously prevail in the event of any inconsistency between the detailed drawings and the General Notes ... '' See further the report by Burgoynes .
To the extent that factual evidence is required on this subject , Mr Robbins of Burgoynes is likely to be the most important witness and he is in Singapore .
\ t As to issue -LRB- 3 -RRB- , evidence will be required from six London underwriters and one underwriter from Stockholm and probably expert witnesses from the London market .
This may be sensitive to some factual evidence from Taiwan -LRB- and evidence as to the law of Taiwan -RRB- .
To the extent that factual evidence is required , I have already referred to Mr Robbins of Burgoynes and to Mr Purdon of GAB Robins .
As a result of the splitting up of that Union disputes have occurred and an agreement was entered into by a number of former soviet shipping companies to deal with the question of their containers , and it is in issue as to whether Azov is a party to that agreement .
\ r \ n The parties have agreed that if there is jurisdiction to arbitrate , in effect , that is to say if Azov is a party to the agreement , then Mr Donald Davies should be their sole arbitrator .
That , however , was under full reservations by Azov as to its not being a party to the agreement and thus there not being jurisdiction in Mr Davies to act as an arbitrator .
Mr Davies rendered his award on 30th January and it was in favour of Baltic , that is to say he found that Azov was a party to the agreement and that he therefore did have jurisdiction .
On behalf of Baltic , Mr Christopher Smith submits that it would be neither just , expeditious nor economical to permit such a complete rehearing .
So that matter is neutral , save , I suppose , that inasmuch as the Report on the Bill contemplates that the running , on such an application , is primarily that of the party who wishes to arbitrate rather than that of the party who wishes to challenge the arbitration , the burden of the absence of such an application rests upon Baltic rather than upon Azov .
In a nutshell , Dubal alleged that its former chief executive , Mr Ian Livingstone , conspired with Mr Hany Salaam , the first defendant , with the assistance of the latter \ 's solicitor Mr Anthony Amhurst , the second defendant , to steal this sum under the guise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services .
Dubal \ 's business , as its full name implies , is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai .
\ tMr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him -LRB- and his wife and companies -RRB- in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal , while denying liability , some $ 15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal \ 's claims .
Dubal alleged that $ 6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme , being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it .
\ tThat balance fell again when in the course of trial Mr Amhurst and his partners in the partnerships of Amhurst Brown Martin & Nicholson -LRB- `` ABMN '' , the third defendants -RRB- and Amhurst Brown Colombotti -LRB- `` ABC '' , the fourth defendants -RRB- settled with Dubal , on terms providing for the payment of $ 10,000,000 to Dubal by ABMN and ABC and the withdrawal of all allegations against Mr Amhurst and the partnerships by Dubal .
\ tMr Livingstone , although not a defendant because of his settlement with Dubal , is a party to these proceedings as first third party .
First , he disputes and rejects Mr Salaam \ 's and Mr Livingstone \ 's explanation for the scheme , and their principal defence as to the honesty of it , that it was legitimately authorised by him as the right hand man and confidant of the Ruler of Dubai and ultimate owner of Dubal .
Secondly , his explanation for the receipt of such funds as he received is that he agreed with Mr Marc Rich , at that time -LRB- in or about May 1987 -RRB- the principal shareholder and director of Richco , a personal commission for himself , payable by Richco out of its own funds , for bringing about a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco .
Dubal agreed that he had no legitimate position or power to authorise the scheme ; but otherwise it did not ultimately take issue with Mr Salaam \ 's -LRB- and Mr Livingstone \ 's -RRB- evidence that Mr Al Tajir was a party to it .
Mr Al Tajir , on the other hand , said that not only did he have no position or power to authorise such a scheme on behalf of Dubal and the Ruler of Dubai , but also that he did not seek to do so at all , whether with or without legitimate authority : he did not participate in the scheme at all , but merely negotiated with Richco a legitimate business commission for himself .
Dubal , having paid out between 4 September 1987 and 11 February 1993 a total of $ 50,117,622 and recovered $ 15,540,000 from Mr Livingstone -LRB- out of which it gave credit in these proceedings for only $ 6,327,918 -RRB- in 1996 and a further $ 10,000,000 from the Amhurst defendants -LRB- out of which it gave credit for $ 9,250,000 and referred the balance of $ 750,000 to costs -RRB- during the course of trial , made the following financial claims against the Salaam defendants : \ t -LRB- 1 -RRB- against Mr Salaam himself : \ t \ t - in knowing assistance : $ 50,117,622 plus interest and costs -LRB- less a credit of $ 15,577,918 -RRB- ; \ t \ t - in knowing receipt : $ 27,848,149.61 etc .
The essence of its case was that Mr Livingstone breached his fiduciary duty as a director and chief executive of Dubal in promoting and participating in the scheme , that Mr Salaam -LRB- and Mr Al Tajir -RRB- were also involved in promoting and participating in the scheme , and in sharing in its rewards .
\ tMr Salaam , on the other hand , said that the scheme was honest in its conception and execution ; that it was intended to benefit Dubal by bringing to it a commercial alliance with the largest and strongest metal trader in the world , Richco , and that that alliance has continued to this day ; that it was promoted to Mr Salaam by Mr Al Tajir himself , with all the prestige and authority that he exercised formally as Director of the Office of the Ruler of Dubai \ 's Affairs or less formally but equally effectively as the real and acknowledged protector in Dubai of Dubal \ 's interests ; that the income earned by him and his companies from the scheme was essentially a reward for securing for Dubal its alliance with Richco , and that custom and practice in Dubai in such matters exonerated him from any accusation of dishonesty ; that Mr Al Tajir \ 's participation in the scheme was likewise a guarantee of its legitimacy , as Mr Amhurst \ 's involvement as a well-known City of London solicitor in the drafting and execution of the documents and in the implementation of the scheme was itself proof of its bona fides .
He did not personally contribute to the payment of $ 10,000,000 to Dubal , all of which was met by his partners in ABMN and ABC .
He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal \ 's affairs as the Ruler \ 's representative .
It was he , Mr Livingstone , who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco .
In his witness statement , which became his evidence in chief before me , he said this : `` What happened in Dubal from 1992 onwards -LSB- when the Richco consultancy agreement came under question , a process which culminated in Mr Livingstone leaving Dubai in October 1992 and in Dubal giving notice to Richco of the termination of the agreement on 22 March 1993 -RSB- was the phenomenon well-known in autocratic feudal regimes ; namely a `` changing of the guard '' .
\ tMr Al Tajir \ 's evidence , however , was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler \ 's Affairs in 1981 , and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal .
The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone , who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally .
Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan , one of the Ruler \ 's sons and chairman of Dubal .
He was assured by Mr Livingstone and Mr Amhurst that the commercial alliance had to be structured in this way in order to be acceptable to Dubal .
It was his understanding , in reliance on Mr Livingstone \ 's executive authority , Mr Al Tajir \ 's political standing and the involvement of a reputable London solicitor , Mr Amhurst -LRB- whom he regarded as acting for Dubal rather than Mr Salaam -RRB- , that the scheme had the approval of Dubal and the government of Dubai .
\ tIn my `` Unreasoned Findings '' I found as follows : Mr Ian Livingstone -LRB- the First Third Party -RRB- was in breach of his fiduciary duties as Chief Executive of Dubai Aluminium Company -LRB- `` Dubal '' -RRB- in connection with the promotion and organisation and operation of a scheme , involving the making and operation of the Richco Consultancy Agreement and the Subsidiary Agreements -LRB- collectively the `` Agreements '' -RRB- , for the payment of monies to be derived from Dubal , routed through Marc Rich & Co AG -LRB- `` Richco '' , the Second Third Party , now known as Glencore International AG -RRB- and paid to participants in the scheme -LRB- the `` scheme '' -RRB- ; and in so doing dishonestly received US$ 6,327,918.09 as one of the participants .
\ r \ n Mr Tajir did not have authority , whether actual or ostensible , from the Ruler of Dubai at the relevant time , HH Sheikh Rashid , nor from the Government of Dubai nor from the ultimate owners of Dubal , to authorise the scheme or the Agreements or the payments made under them , and there was no honest belief by any of the participants in such authority .
\ r \ n In ordinary circumstances Richco would have been entitled to charge Dubal a fee in return for services rendered under the RCA , and one fifth of 2.5 % , ie 0.5 % , of the value of all sales of Dubal \ 's products would have been a reasonable and legitimate fee .
\ r \ n In March 1995 Dubal commenced proceedings against Mr Livingstone in respect of claims arising out of the scheme as well as other claims .
Dubal gives credit to Mr Salaam in respect of that settlement in the sum of $ 6,327,918.09 , thus reducing their claim in knowing assistance against Mr Salaam from the gross sum of $ 50,117,622 to $ 43,789,703.91 ; but Dubal has failed to prove that the admitted recovery arising out of the Livingstone settlement is to be limited to the sum of $ 6,327,918.09 .
Only ABMN and ABC had contributed to the payment of monies under the settlement agreement with Dubal , and therefore only ABMN and ABC were in the position of claiming a contribution from others .
ABMN and ABC -LRB- other than Mr Amhurst -RRB- sought contribution from the Salaam defendants , Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir -LRB- but not from Richco -RRB- .
The effect of this settlement , therefore , was that , for instance in the case of Mr Salaam , Dubal \ 's claim had at that time fallen to : $ 50,117,622 plus interest and costs less $ 6,327,918.09 -LRB- the Livingstone settlement -RRB- , $ 9,250,000 -LRB- the Amhurst settlement -RRB- and then $ 18,000,000 -LRB- the Al Tajir settlement -RRB- .
JMS was to receive -LRB- a -RRB- half of the 2.5 % fee on sales provided for in the Richco consultancy agreement , and in addition -LRB- b -RRB- a fee of $ 5 per tonne of alumina supplied by Clarendon under the ASA plus a fee of $ 2 per tonne of alumina traded between Dubal and Richco and/or Clarendon in addition to the annual tonnage supplied pursuant to the ASA -LRB- the `` $ 5s and $ 2s '' -RRB- .
For each year Clarendon agreed to sell , and Dubal agreed to buy a base quantity of 260,000 tonnes of alumina , with options to increase or decrease .
Although the ASA contained full terms for the physical delivery of alumina , the contract contemplated that in at any rate 1988 and 1989 Dubal would be primarily supplied by its pre-existing supplier , Alcoa , and the ASA would for those years operate only as a contract for differences , in the sense that if the price payable by Dubal to Alcoa were lower than the ASA formula price , then Dubal would pay the difference to Clarendon , and vice versa .
In effect , therefore , the ASA guaranteed to Dubal a source of supply for 10 years at a price , related to the market price of aluminium in 1988 , and thereafter determined by put and call options .
\ tAs matters turned out , Dubal did well out of the ASA for two years , until the pricing formula was changed by an amendment in September 1989 .
Dubai , the Dubal smelter , and Gulf Resources Corporation \ tI now have to set the Richco consultancy agreement in its historical context .
\ tDubai is one of the Gulf emirates , part of the United Arab Emirates -LRB- UAE -RRB- .
In 1971 Dubai became one of the seven founding emirates of the UAE , a federation with a central constitution , but within each individual emirate power remained in the hands of the Ruler and his family .
-LSB- 5 -RSB- \ tSheikh Rashid died in October 1990 , and was succeeded by his eldest son , HH Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum -LRB- `` Sheikh Maktoum '' , the present Ruler of Dubai -RRB- .
He remained , however , UAE Ambassador to the Court of St James , an Emirates post , until 1987 .
There is nevertheless no dispute that at least up to 1981 Mr Al Tajir spoke for the Ruler , and played an active role , in connection with the affairs of the project for the construction of an aluminium smelter in Dubai and ultimately of Dubal itself .
Mr Salaam , who had been involved in the development of aluminium and chemical plants in the Gulf , was himself an early exponent of the idea of an aluminium smelter for Dubai .
Sheikh Rashid started out as owner initially of 80 % of Dubal \ 's shares , but before long acquired the remaining 20 % .
\ tIn February 1978 Mr Livingstone , who was by profession a chartered accountant but had long worked in industry , commenced work as managing director of Dubal .
That company was the constructor of the smelter , and had previously built the Alba -LRB- Aluminium Bahrain -RRB- smelter in Bahrain .
Mr Livingstone had been first finance manager and then general manager at Alba since February 1971 , and had guided it through the final stages of construction into start-up and then established production .
In October 1979 Mr Livingstone succeeded Mr Brauner as deputy chairman and a director of Dubal and also became its chief executive .
By clause 1 of each Mr Livingstone was empowered - `` To transact , manage , carry on and do all and every business matter deemed requisite and necessary or in any manner connected with or having reference to the business and affairs of the company in relation to the financing of the company \ 's business , the placing of contracts and all other relevant matters of whatsoever nature pertaining to the whole of the company \ 's undertaking and business including without limiting the generality thereof its smelter and related products in Dubai and elsewhere '' and by clause 9 he was authorised - `` To execute sign enter into acknowledge perfect and do all such deals agreements instruments acts and things which will be requisite for or in relation to all or any of the purposes or matters aforesaid .
\ tIt is common ground that by reason of his appointment as chief executive , director and attorney of Dubal , there was a fiduciary relationship between Mr Livingstone and Dubal and a fiduciary duty owed by the former to protect the latter and its assets .
Mr Salaam and the GRC Management Agreement \ tOn 29 October 1979 , on the same day that Mr Livingstone entered upon his new appointments and received his powers of attorney , the board of Dubal approved and Mr Livingstone signed on behalf of Dubal a management contract with one of Mr Salaam \ 's Panamanian companies known as Gulf Resources Corporation -LRB- `` GRC '' -RRB- .
Over the last half century or so his family has provided three prime ministers of Lebanon and one of Jordan , has founded Middle East Airlines , and has played an important role in the business development of the Gulf states .
He was first introduced to him in Lebanon at a time when Mr Al Tajir was already the Director of the Ruler of Dubai \ 's Affairs .
\ tIn about 1971 Mr Salaam was touring the Gulf states with the chairman of Kaiser Aluminium , seeking to promote a `` Grand Smelter Scheme '' , for the repetition of the Alba project in other nations such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Abu Dhabi and Dubai .
He met Sheikh Rashid and Mr Al Tajir in Dubai in connection with these ideas .
Instead , Dubai turned to BSCL -LRB- a company within the Wimpey group -RRB- for the construction of the Dubal smelter .
Dubal \ 's thesis in this connection was that the GRC management agreement was an attempt , a very successful attempt , to fleece Dubal , orchestrated by Mr Salaam , Mr Al Tajir and Mr Livingstone : in other words a prototype of the Richco consultancy agreement scheme .
It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal \ 's manager , and so did Mr Livingstone .
In its action against Mr Livingstone , one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement .
Mr Livingstone \ 's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage -LRB- on day 10 at 88/91 -RRB- : \ t `` Q. \ tGRC was thus extremely well remunerated under this agreement , was it not .
By 2 February , the Government of Dubai , in the name of the Ruler but effectively in the form of a committee chaired by Sheikh Mohamed and also containing on it Mr Ahmed Al Tayer , the finance minister of the UAE and a confidant of Sheikh Hamdan , but significantly not Mr Al Tajir , had commissioned a report on Dubal from the accountants , Messrs Price Waterhouse .
\ tAs a result of this recommendation , Mr Livingstone began to report to Mr Al Tayer in Dubai and to Mr Amhurst in London in connection with the renegotiation of the GRC agreement .
However , in an affidavit which Mr Salaam made for the purpose of these proceedings -LRB- his third affirmation , at para 83 -RRB- Mr Salaam had said this : `` I recall that at one stage I was sufficiently frustrated by what was going on and the confused messages which were coming through to GRC that I intervened directly with HH Sheikh Mohamed ... What I do clearly recall is that in my audience with HH Sheikh Mohamed while there was , predictably given the political rivalries endemic to Dubai life , a certain amount of invective about HE Mahdi Tajir and the money HH Sheikh Mohamed -LRB- no doubt , correctly -RRB- believed that he was earning in connection with his stewardship of Dubal and about Mr Livingstone , HH Sheikh Mohamed was not critical of me or GRC ... '' \ tMr Salaam was asked about that passage in his affirmation -LRB- at day 8 , page 20 -RRB- : \ t `` Q. \ tWould you like to tell his Lordship about the certain amount of invective about Mr Al Tajir at your meeting with Sheikh Mohamed that you refer to in this paragraph .
Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions , and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any `` commission '' to any one .
\ tIn my judgment , however , the critical fact behind the rise and fall of GRC was that in 1979 when the management agreement was made , Mr Al Tajir was in the ascendant , whereas after 1981 , when Sheikh Rashid suffered an incapacitating stroke , he had lost his power base in Dubai as the representative of the Ruler and the Director of his Affairs .
\ tSheikh Rashid remained the Ruler of Dubai until his death in 1990 : but from the time of his incapacitating stroke in 1981 , his effective rule was over .
Mr Briggs had served throughout his working life in various police forces in the middle east , and in 1965 became the Commandant of Police in Dubai , at Sheikh Rashid \ 's personal request .
Mr Briggs also said that Mr Al Tajir \ 's office at the Ruler \ 's court was vacated shortly afterwards and he ceased thereafter to carry out any duties or functions on behalf of the government of Dubai .
It was put to Mr Briggs on behalf of Mr Livingstone -LRB- day 2 , page 75 -RRB- that `` when Sheikh Mohamed took over responsibility for Dubai Petroleum , Mahdi Tajir stopped going to his office every day but still retained his office there , he still retained his desk there and the staff continued to work for him ?
Mr Briggs also made it clear that following Mr Al Tajir \ 's exit from an official role in government in Dubai , everyone knew of the change in his status .
As Mr Briggs said -LRB- day 10 , page 83 -RRB- in the context of Sheikh Mohamed \ 's letter : `` this sort of thing in the place like Dubai goes round .
\ tOnly Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone say that Mr Al Tajir remained in power and in office as Sheikh Rashid \ 's representative , at any rate in matters relating to Dubal , and able to authorise the Richco scheme : that is evidence which , for the reasons given above , I can not accept .
\ tThe importance of the GRC management contract is therefore this : it shows Mr Salaam , Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir associated in an earlier venture under which the proceeds of a highly profitable management contract with Dubal passed into their hands ; and it shows that that contract was brought to an end after the ill-health of Sheikh Rashid had led to the resignation of Mr Al Tajir from his previous role in government as the representative of the Ruler and the Director of the Ruler \ 's Office ; and it shows that Sheikh Mohamed , who had effectively succeeded to Mr Al Tajir \ 's position , had told Mr Salaam that Mr Al Tajir \ 's `` ways of business are over '' .
At that time Mr Al Tajir spoke to him about Dubal , apparently with the authority of the Dubai government : Mr Salaam asserted that Mr Al Tajir was still Director of the Ruler \ 's Office and of Petroleum Affairs .
He recognised that his influence and presence in government affairs had waned , but that this `` did not apply to Dubal ... where Mahdi Tajir \ 's authority on behalf of the Dubai Government was unquestioned '' .
He asked his employees at GRC , a Mr Mike Thomas and a Mr Ray Christopherson , to investigate the possibility of alternative gas supplies for Dubal .
As for a proposed United States sales agency , this was delegated to his right hand man and chief accountant in his organisation , Mr Alex Ayoub -LRB- who unfortunately died in 1991 -RRB- , as well as to his solicitor , Mr Amhurst , in liaison with Mr Livingstone .
This was negotiated with Mr Livingstone and vetted by Dubal \ 's own solicitors , Messrs Allen & Overy .
Mr Al Tajir set up a meeting with Mr Rich , to be attended by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone .
He looked on the detail of the Richco/Dubal side of the arrangement to be a matter for Mr Livingstone to discuss with Richco , while his `` essential role '' was to persuade Mr Rich himself into an alliance and , if that succeeded , to negotiate with him the terms on which he -LRB- Mr Salaam -RRB- and Mr Al Tajir were to receive commission for introducing Dubal and Richco to one another .
He knew that I knew Dubai and Dubal well .
They reflected the fees already negotiated with Dubal in the context of the Valo sales agreement : the $ 2m was an upfront mobilisation fee , without which he was not prepared to commit GRC \ 's resources , a `` show of goodwill and seriousness '' , and the $ 85,000 monthly fee was an estimate of the likely costs of an office in Dubai -LRB- if one should be needed -RRB- .
It was only as things turned out that , once Mr Rich was comfortable with his relationship with Dubal , he , together with Mr Al Tajir and Mr Livingstone , effectively excluded Mr Salaam from further involvement .
He did not regard Mr Livingstone \ 's windfall as unusual : senior executives in the Gulf or Arab world would often be compensated in such form , in the absence of share options or the other elements of a remuneration package which might have been available in the West .
This was effected through Mr Livingstone and with the aid of Mr Amhurst : on 28 February 1988 Mr Amhurst instructed Richco on behalf of JMS -LRB- and Valo -RRB- that 15 % of the amount payable to those subsidiaries should be paid to a separate account at Banque Gutzwiller , Geneva .
In 1987 Mr Livingstone was concerned about the following aspects of Dubal \ 's business : long term financial success required a fourth potline , but Mr Al Tajir informed him that the Ruler would not be willing to fund the expansion himself ; expansion was unsafe without ensuring the availability of increased supplies of alumina at reasonable prices ; as it was , Alcoa was indicating that it no longer wished to continue as Dubal \ 's exclusive supplier ; tariff problems were causing difficulties in finding sufficient outlets for Dubal \ 's premium products .
The ASA would not have been possible on the terms agreed with Clarendon but for the consultancy agreement .
\ tWith Mr Al Tajir \ 's approval , Mr Livingstone therefore began negotiating with Mr Rich -LRB- `` I had known Marc Rich personally for many years '' -RRB- and with Mr Salaam .
The division of payment was discussed at lunch -LRB- at the Mirabelle restaurant in London -RRB- in mid 1987 .
\ tThe negotiations with Mr Rich included Mr Livingstone himself .
As , however , discussions developed for the ASA , so Mr Rich and Mr Salaam were prepared to agree a 50 % / 50 % split with additional payments becoming due to Mr Salaam \ 's companies on sales and purchases under the ASA .
It began on a Thursday , when he was cross-examined first by Mr Boswood on behalf of the Amhurst defendants and then by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal .
He was also involved in the arrangements made in September 1988 for a bogus option undertaken between Clarendon and Dubal under which Clarendon paid $ 3,000,000 to Nillet , and which , when unscrambled , led to the need to repay the $ 3m : Mr Livingstone said that the $ 3m had originally gone to Mr Salaam , `` who had problems with his cashflow '' , and that when the money had to be repaid , it came out of his , Mr Livingstone \ 's , own pocket .
\ tThere was another bogus option for $ 2.6 million arranged by Mr Livingstone in December 1988 : it was Dubal who this time paid that money to Richco as the price of the option , and Clarendon in due course paid that money on to an account in Zurich for the benefit of Metal Production Consultants , a company under the control of M & F Engineering , in payment of the cost of hiring aircraft in connection with Mr Al Tajir \ 's shuttle diplomacy in the Lebanese peace process .
Mr Livingstone explained -LRB- day 10 , page 38ff -RRB- : \ t `` A. \ t. ... These were substantial bills which really had nothing to do with -LSB- Dubal -RSB- and I was charged with finding a way in which to settle the matter ... \ tQ .
Later in the day , in answer to Mr Seymour , he became franker still , and all but dropped the defence that Mr Tajir \ 's authority made such arrangements proper in the `` other '' world of Dubai .
If the plant did not succeed , if it did not start and produce and sell metal , consequences would be catastrophic for Dubai , not just for the Dubal .
\ tMr Livingstone \ 's cross-examination continued on the following Monday : he was then cross-examined by Mr Nigel Davis QC on behalf of Mr Salaam and by Mr Ali Malek QC on behalf of Mr Al Tajir .
Thus he was asked why he had not sought to defend himself against the proceedings which Dubal had brought against him by seeking to implicate Mr Al Tajir , in reliance on the latter \ 's legitimate authority in Dubai to promote the scheme .
He said that Mr Al Tajir as well as he wanted Mr Salaam to be involved ; and that it was he , Mr Livingstone , who had negotiated with Mr Rich .
He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such , but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai .
Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone \ 's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman , Sheikh Hamdan , about them .
In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems .
He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich , his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz , personally .
He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug -LRB- Richco \ 's headquarters -RRB- .
Mr Rich suggested that `` his people '' meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures .
At about this time , Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich .
He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988 , and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east , but he was never told of Mr Salaam \ 's involvement in the Richco deal , nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone .
This encompassed all businesses with Richco , including business ventures other than Dubal , including commodity trading with Iran ... hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family ... '' \ tAs for Mr Saad Salaam , Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers , whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf .
\ tIn late spring or early summer of 1987 -LRB- we now know that it was on 26 or 27 May -RRB- , Mr Rich and Mr Pincus Green -LRB- the latter being Richco \ 's President - there has been no evidence from him either -RRB- came into Mr Strothotte \ 's office to say that they had that day met Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam .
Dubal had proposed the passing over of 80 % of the fees , but Mr Rich thought that too high .
He , Mr Strothotte , regarded Mr Livingstone as in executive control of Dubal , and Mr Al Tajir as a man of considerable political influence , who filled a power vacuum left by the inactivity of the sick Ruler \ 's sons : the scheme therefore appeared to be approved by the government of Dubai .
Nevertheless , in accepting them he relied on the executive authority of Mr Livingstone , the political standing of Mr Al Tajir , and the involvement of an apparently reputable London solicitor , Mr Amhurst .
\ tSheikh Hamdan \ 's main concern , apart from dealing with the matter of Mr Al Tajir \ 's succession by Sheikh Mohamed as effective director of the Ruler \ 's Affairs and Petroleum Affairs in 1981 , was to oppose the evidence given by Mr Livingstone to the effect that he had taken no interest as chairman in Dubal \ 's affairs , and had left matters to his executives and to Mr Al Tajir .
He said that he was always available at his majlis -LSB- 13 -RSB- for any meeting which Mr Livingstone desired , and that he did meet Mr Livingstone regularly to discuss Dubal \ 's affairs .
In any event , I am absolutely sure that Mr Livingstone did not tell me that it was intended Dubal would enter into a consultancy agreement with a third party as a means by which substantial sums of money were to be paid by Dubal to either himself or Mr Salaam or Mr Altajir .
He has had special responsibility for locating all files relevant to the Livingstone or current proceedings brought by Dubal .
There are no documents , whether in report form , or in informal form , relating to any market research or market intelligence information provided by Richco to Dubal ; there are no documents prior to September 1987 suggesting Dubal \ 's inability to sell its products at satisfactory prices ; there are no documents prior to September 1987 suggesting or investigating a problem in relation to the supply of alumina ; there are no documents which suggest that Dubal was receiving any instructions from or having contact with Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the government of Dubai , or at all -LRB- other than in the context of projects outside Dubai , eg a smelter project in Iran -RRB- ; and there are no documents relating to the proposed Valo sales agency .
\ tMr Farhad Pochkhanawala , Dubal \ 's finance manager since 1989 , also provided a witness statement in which he said that as finance manager he became a member of the Pricing Committee , whose role was to review market information and advise on pricing and hedging strategies for the benefit of Mr Livingstone and Mr Alawi , the sales manager .
\ tFirst , each of Mr Salaam , Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir claimed to have been the instrumental party in effecting the alliance with Richco through an initial approach to Marc Rich .
Mr Al Tajir , on the other hand , said that although the initial idea of an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone , it was he , Mr Al Tajir , who had made the initial contact with his friend and neighbour Mr Rich .
And Mr Livingstone said that it was he himself who had both developed the strategy of an alliance with Richco and had negotiated it with Mr Rich , who was personally known to him .
That was Mr Salaam \ 's view of the matter , that it had been Mr Al Tajir who had set up the initial meeting that he and Mr Livingstone attended with Mr Rich in Zug .
Mr Livingstone may have been Dubal \ 's chief executive , but it was Mr Rich and Mr Al Tajir who were the world business men , principals rather than employees : and it seems to me to be altogether more likely that the meetings of 26/27 May 1987 in Zug had been preceded by some private conversation between Mr Rich and Mr Al Tajir .
That was in a sense also Mr Strothotte \ 's understanding from Mr Rich , that Mr Al Tajir had been involved -LRB- as well as the two visitors to Zug -RRB- : but I pay less regard to that , since Mr Strothotte was obviously mistaken to think , as he had originally said , that Mr Rich had reported having had a joint meeting with Messrs Al Tajir , Livingstone and Salaam in Zug ; and in any event what Mr Rich said to Mr Strothotte was merely hearsay .
\ tSecondly , if Mr Al Tajir made the initial contact with Mr Rich , it is nevertheless reasonably clear that the original concept of the alliance came from Mr Livingstone , or at any rate developed out of his conversations and discussions with Mr Al Tajir and/or Mr Salaam .
It is also a matter of common sense : it was Mr Livingstone who alone of the three lived his whole business life in the world of Dubal .
Following Mr Livingstone \ 's departure from Dubal and Dubai , Mr Salaam was able to offer him a consultancy appointment with GRC .
Mr Al Tajir \ 's stance is the most clear cut , in that he seeks to say that his 40 % was negotiated directly with Mr Rich as the price he charged to Richco for introducing it to Dubal .
It seemed to me that politically , or for some other reason , it was unacceptable for Dubal to pay direct , and the concept of State companies in developing countries distributing funds to favoured individuals or companies was consistent with what I had heard about such dealings ... '' \ tMr Livingstone , perhaps even more than Mr Salaam , accepted that the fees were being paid by Dubal , rather than Richco .
\ tUltimately , the fact that both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone relied on the authority of Mr Al Tajir and on the custom and practice of Dubai showed that their thesis was that their commissions or other payments came from Dubal , rather than Richco .
\ tSixthly , for reasons which I have already sought to make plain , the reliance which both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone , and through Mr Strothotte to some lesser extent also Richco , sought to place on the authority of Mr Al Tajir as representative of the Ruler of Dubai and owner of Dubal can not be accepted .
Mr Al Tajir was no longer vested with that authority : and it is impossible to accept that Mr Livingstone or Mr Salaam , or even Mr Rich , can have supposed that Mr Al Tajir was still vested with the Ruler \ 's authority .
It contains a helpful summary of all sums received by Richco pursuant to the Richco consultancy agreement and paid out by Richco pursuant to the subsidiary agreements , as well as , in addition , details of the further payments made by Richco of $ 10 per tonne of alumina sold to Dubal by Clarendon .
Mr Horat said that for internal accounting purposes `` there would have been a transfer by Richco to Clarendon of the funds received from Dubal under the Consultancy Agreement to enable Clarendon to make payment out to the Beneficiaries .
\ tFor the most part , payments by Richco -LRB- by which I mean to embrace , for the reason just stated , payments made by Clarendon -RRB- were made within a few days after the corresponding payment was received by Richco from Dubal .
On 4 September 1987 Dubal paid to Richco , and on 8 September 1987 Richco paid on to Valo at the Fidelity Bank , London , the mobilisation fee of $ 2m and the first monthly payment of $ 85,000 .
\ tOn 15 December 1989 Richco -LRB- Clarendon -RRB- paid $ 1,400,000 to an account number 12.822 in the name of `` J Diem '' held at Bank fur Handel und Effekten , Zurich .
It appears to be linked in that schedule in some way with a similar payment , also ascribed to the $ 5s , made by Richco -LRB- Clarendon -RRB- to Al Tajir Ltd on 23 February 1990 : in that case too there appears to be no payment from Dubal to Richco in the same or similar amount either shortly before or after that date .
This shows that the $ 1,400,000 is a prepayment in respect of an estimated quantity of 300,000 tonnes of alumina to be supplied by Clarendon to Dubal in calendar 1990 : 300,000 x $ 5 = $ 1,500,000 , from which $ 100,000 was discounted for early payment .
\ tMr Livingstone was also questioned in this context about documents showing that he and Mr Salaam were in account with one another regarding an investment in the Fidelity Bank Building , Philadelphia , which Mr Salaam and Mr Al Tajir had originally bought in partnership together .
It is not clear if this is the same sum as was transferred by Richco -LRB- Clarendon -RRB- to Mr Salaam at Bank fur Handel -LRB- the identity of the amount and the closeness of the dates are intriguing -RRB- , or whether it is a different sum of $ 1,400,000 .
\ t -LRB- 2 -RRB- In respect of the $ 5s : \ t \ t $ 2,312,733 to Al Tajir Ltd -LRB- Mr Al Tajir -RRB- \ t \ t $ 1,623,789 to Mr Salaam -LRB- at Bank fur Handel -RRB- \ t \ t $ 762,789 to Utary -LRB- Mr Livingstone -RRB- \ t \ t $ 1,082,525 to Saad Salaam \ t -LRB- 3 -RRB- In respect of the monthly payments of $ 85,000 : \ t \ t $ 1,501,213 to Mr Salaam -LRB- at Bank fur Handel -RRB- \ t \ t $ 1,574,771 to Utary -LRB- Mr Livingstone -RRB- .
The figure is made up as follows : \ t -LRB- a -RRB- \ tValo -LRB- the mobilisation fee of $ 2m and six monthly payments of $ 85,000 -RRB- : \ t \ t $ 2,510,000 \ t -LRB- b -RRB- \ tNillet -LRB- 35 monthly payments of $ 85,000 -RRB- : \ t $ 2,975,000 -LSB- 16 -RSB- \ t -LRB- c -RRB- \ tJMS -LRB- the payments in respect of 2.5 % commission and the $ 5s and $ 2s , made to JMS \ 's account at Fidelity Bank , London and latterly First City Bank , Houston -RRB- : \ t \ t $ 8,270,985.33 -LSB- 17 -RSB- \ t -LRB- d -RRB- \ tMr Salaam personally -LRB- the payments made into his account at Bank fur Handel -RRB- : \ t $ 8,090,303 \ t -LRB- e -RRB- \ tMr Salaam personally or through his companies -LRB- items -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- b -RRB- , -LRB- c -RRB- and -LRB- d -RRB- above -RRB- : \ t $ 21,846,488.39 -LSB- 18 -RSB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Mr Saad Salaam received -LRB- at Banque Gutzwiller -RRB- the total sum of $ 6,001,861.28 .
This was the figure adopted by Dubal , accepted Mr Livingstone , and not disputed by Mr Salaam or the other parties .
It is possible , however , or even likely , that prior to November 1990 Mr Livingstone received additional sums under the scheme , indirectly from Dubal , through JMS .
-LRB- 9 -RRB- The two sums of $ 1,400,000 and $ 1,296,944 , paid in respect of the $ 5s in the former case to Mr Salaam -LRB- at Bank fur Handel -RRB- in December 1989 and in the latter to Al Tajir Ltd in February 1990 , are included in the above figures as receipts of Mr Salaam and of Mr Al Tajir respectively .
As to the former , a third party will be liable as a constructive trustee if he is the recipient beneficially of trust property or of assets representing that property , in the knowledge that the property of which he is in receipt is traceable to a breach of trust or fiduciary relationship : see Agip -LRB- Africa -RRB- Ltd v. Jackson -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 Ch 265 -LRB- Millett J -RRB- , -LSB- 1991 -RSB- Ch 547 -LRB- CA -RRB- , El Ajou v. Dollar Land Holdings -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 2 All E R 685 .
As to this issue , Lord Nicholls pointed out that the jumping-off point had been Lord Selborne LC \ 's famous dictum in Barnes v. Addy -LRB- 1874 -RRB- LR 9 Ch App 244 at 251/2 that - '' ... strangers are not to be made constructive trustees ... unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustees .
\ tNevertheless , it was submitted by Mr Davis on behalf of the Salaam defendants that Lord Nicholls was mistaken , and that their Lordships \ ' advice in the Privy Council in Tan could not be reconciled with binding authority in the court of appeal in cases such as Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v. Williams Furniture Ltd -LSB- 1979 -RSB- Ch 250 , eg at 267G , where Buckley LJ said : '' -LSB- Lord Selborne LC \ 's -RSB- formulation has stood for more than 100 years .
In Tan the privy council reviewed all lines of earlier authority , and preferred the test of dishonesty to other fault-based principles , relying in this connection on the Belmont case itself -LRB- at 388B/E -RRB- : but that still left open for further refinement the question of the test of dishonesty itself .
In Arab Monetary Fund v. Hashim -LRB- unreported , 29 July 1994 -RRB- Chadwick J -LRB- at 45/6 of the transcript -RRB- said this : \ t `` The second requirement , as it seems to me , was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin -LRB- supra , -LSB- 1971 -RSB- AC 356 , 397 -RRB- - would provide a defence to the AMF \ 's cause of action ; or - as it might , perhaps , be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee .
As it is , Dubal made it clear that , while it only had to meet the test in Tan , what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty , the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest `` theft '' .
Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest : but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone \ 's honesty was itself in issue .
Mr El Fadl was born in Kuwait and is now an American citizen and member of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey bars .
He is also a member of the Committee on Islamic and International Law of the American Branch of the International Law Association , an adjunct Professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law at the University of Texas , and a consultant to the law firm of Medhat Abou El Fadl in Cairo .
Instead , reliance is there placed on passages from the evidence of Mr Livingstone , Mr Salaam , Mr Strothotte and Mr Briggs to the effect that commissions were part of the accepted culture of Dubai .
I would merely add that , if I had received compelling evidence , tested under cross-examination , that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned , I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland , evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law , and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland , England and the USA .
There was no dispute that Mr Livingstone was in a fiduciary relationship with Dubal , or that he had participated in the making of the Richco consultancy agreement , the setting up of the scheme , and the receiving of payments under it .
\ tIn my judgment , the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai .
Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of Dubal and lived in Dubai .
He must have been aware of this all the more because the fall or at least departure of Mr Al Tajir from his previous official , governmental and personal status as the Ruler \ 's representative was in my judgment the reason why the GRC management agreement began to unravel : and that was a matter in which Mr Livingstone was intimately involved both as the chief executive of Dubal and by reason of his personal interest in the profits of that agreement .
The very fact that Mr Livingstone has staked so much on his contention and his evidence that Mr Al Tajir still retained his former status , or that he at least believed him to have done so , at any rate in relation to Dubal , means , with my rejection of that contention and evidence , that Mr Livingstone has been shown to have taken up a false position : and that is symptomatic of his lack of honesty in relation to the scheme .
I can not accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai , that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal , and that the creaming off of Dubal \ 's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate .
As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit , the GRC agreement was `` a means of abstracting cash from Dubal '' , and involved the theft of money from Dubal -LRB- `` If you wish to put it that way '' -RRB- .
In my judgment , the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were , with Mr Livingstone \ 's dishonest complicity , in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal \ 's money : for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco .
Under the Richco scheme , no one at Dubal , except for Mr Livingstone himself , was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme .
This was so both when he was first questioned about the Richco consultancy agreement in 1992 before he left Dubal , and when he was sued by Dubal in the Livingstone proceedings .
I can not accept that Mr Al Tajir would have sought to lead Mr Salaam into the belief , or leave him disabused in the belief , that he retained his former role within the government of Dubai or in the affairs of Dubal .
He knew that Mr Livingstone was responsible to Dubal and its owners for its proper management , and that his participation in a scheme for diverting its assets under the guise of a `` strategic partnership '' with Richco was dishonest .
Even if the earning of an unofficial bonus could be regarded as a legitimate part of the mores of Dubai business life , at any rate when authorised by Dubal \ 's owners , Mr Salaam knew that the immense sums allotted to Mr Livingstone were not the payment of a bonus , but the price of an indispensable partner in dishonesty .
Moreover , if Mr Salaam \ 's share of the payments routed through Dubal was the payment of an introductory commission to him , what were the payments to Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir .
The fact is , as Mr Livingstone accepted but Mr Salaam continued to deny , that the scheme was a device for abstracting money from Dubal , and that Mr Salaam together with Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir divided up the spoils by agreement between themselves .
It was Mr Salaam who went to Zug with Mr Livingstone in May 1987 to negotiate the scheme with Mr Rich .
His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together , for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly , and separately , with Marc Rich himself .
In my view it would be unrealistic to accept that evidence ; but be that as it may , in my view the inference is inescapable that Richco , through Mr Marc Rich himself , must have had a full understanding of the scheme , including the fact that the ultimate beneficiaries were to include Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone as well as Mr Al Tajir .
It was again with Mr Rich that Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone had their initial discussions when they visited Zug in May 1987 .
\ tMr Strothotte \ 's evidence was to some extent ambivalent about whether the scheme was regarded by Richco as one that it could honestly enter into : as essentially redounding to Dubal \ 's benefit and in reliance on Mr Al Tajir \ 's `` political standing '' , Mr Livingstone \ 's executive authority , and Mr Amhurst \ 's professional reputation ; or whether it was recognised as being flawed by dishonesty in its very conception .
Thus he said -LRB- at day 6 , pages 11/12 -RRB- : `` Q. \ tAs far as you were aware , and I am talking about you and Richco , the authority within Dubal to conclude the commercial alliance , you saw that authority , first of all , in Mr Livingstone , as chief executive .
\ tTo some extent Richco must get credit , even though it was acting under the exigencies of seeking to preserve its commercial relationship with Dubal , for being willing both to accommodate Dubal \ 's concerns about the agreements entered into under Mr Livingstone \ 's stewardship and to provide information to Dubal to enable it to pursue its claims .
It will be recalled that the Amhurst defendants had for the purpose of the contribution proceedings divided into two separate interests : Mr Amhurst himself , now represented by Mr Leggatt ; and ABMN and ABC excluding Mr Amhurst , whom Mr Boswood continued to represent -LRB- the `` Amhurst partners '' -RRB- .
\ tIn the present case it was not disputed , on the basis of my unreasoned findings , that Mr Salaam , Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir -LRB- and for that matter Richco too at such time as Mr Salaam was claiming contribution from it -RRB- were all persons liable in respect of the same damage suffered by Dubal for the purposes of section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act , and could therefore each claim contribution against the other or could each be the subject of a claim for contribution by any other .
\ tI also bear in mind that , receipts apart , I have found that Mr Salaam \ 's dishonest assistance led to Dubal \ 's gross loss of $ 50,117,622 , that Mr Livingstone , Mr Al Tajir and Richco were dishonest participants in the scheme , that Mr Amhurst must be treated as dishonestly assisting the scheme in his role as a solicitor , and that each of them played an important and substantial , and not merely peripheral or incidental , role in the scheme -LRB- Unreasoned Finding para 10 -RRB- .
Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme , namely $ 6,327,918 .
It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone , however , that the whole of the sum of $ 15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings .
It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone : it is possible therefore that some , most or even all of Dubal \ 's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal \ 's claim in these proceedings .
If , therefore , it wishes to say that the $ 15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim , but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings , then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof .
At that time , however , I did have to hand calculations which Dubal had provided illustrating the build-up of interest month by month on the basis of simple interest at 1 % , alternatively 2 % , over the prevailing US dollar LIBOR for 3 month deposits , and also on the basis of the same alternative rates applied to interest compounded at annual rests .
Mr Livingstone therefore paid Dubal approximately 22.8 % of its original claim .
Mr Amhurst was a solicitor , and a director of a number of companies in Mr Salaam \ 's group , including Valo ; he represented to Richco that he held powers of attorney for Nillet and JMS ; he drafted or dictated the drafting of the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements and was involved with Mr Livingstone in their negotiation , so much so that he `` appeared to be part of the Dubal team '' ; he informed Richco that it was required to concur in the scheme if it was to do business in Dubai or with Dubal ; he knew and made known to Richco that it was not expected to supply services pursuant to its consultancy agreement or to be supplied with services under the subsidiary agreements and that the scheme was a mere vehicle for payment , and thus knew that the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were shams ; he executed the subsidiary agreements on behalf of the Salaam companies ; thereafter he was `` centrally involved in the administration '' of the scheme , eg by giving instructions to Richco concerning the payment of money .
Mr Salaam , Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir -LRB- but not Richco or Mr Amhurst -RRB- submitted that on the facts pleaded by Dubal against the Amhurst partners they could not have been made liable to Dubal .
In para 7.6 of its points of claim Dubal had pleaded as follows : `` Further or in the alternative to the previous paragraph hereof , at trial , Dubal will say that the firms of ABMN and ABC are liable to Dubal to the same extent as is Amhurst in respect of those acts or omissions alleged against him in section 6 above as were committed by him while a partner therein , to the extent that such acts alleged against him were carried out by him in the ordinary course of ABMN \ 's and/or ABC \ 's business .
\ tOn the other hand , it is submitted on behalf of the Amhurst partners -LRB- supported by Mr Amhurst and Richco -RRB- that the drafting of contracts is plainly within the ordinary business of solicitors , even if that is done as part of a scheme of dishonest assistance to a breach of trust ; that there is nothing to prevent a firm or company being vicariously liable for such dishonest assistance and that section 10 is intended to deal with vicarious liability in general ; that the line of authority relied on by the opposing parties was of uncertain value in the light of the principles vindicated for instance in Lloyd v. Grace Smith -LSB- 1912 -RSB- AC 716 , and had in any event not been followed in the most recent case of Agip -LRB- Africa -RRB- Ltd v. Jackson & Others -LSB- 1990 -RSB- Ch 265 , -LSB- 1991 -RSB- Ch 547 -LRB- CA -RRB- .
On that basis I do not consider Mr Wignall should be regarded as a constructive trustee and liable to account ... '' \ tOn the other side Mr Boswood cites Agip -LRB- Africa -RRB- Ltd v. Jackson -LSB- 1990 -RSB- Ch 265 , -LSB- 1991 -RSB- Ch 547 where Millett J at first instance and the court of appeal found an accountant , Bowers , vicariously liable for the dishonest assistance of his partner , Jackson , as well as of his employee , Griffin : at 296E , 570D .
It has to be said that there appears to have been no dispute that the vicarious liability of Bowers followed automatically upon the liability of his partner , and there is no citation in the judgments of the Partnership Act or of Mara v. Browne and In re Bell \ 's Indenture .
\ tI was also referred to LINDLEY & BANKS , 17th Edition , 1995 , at 12-21 , 12-29 , 12-118 and 12-141 and SNELL \ 's Equity , 29th Edition , 1990 , at 194 , where Mara v. Browne and In re Bell \ 's Indenture are cited without criticism , and to UNDERHILL and HAYTON , Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees , 15th Edition , 1995 , where , on the other hand , it is remarked that In re Bell \ 's Indenture has been criticised on the ground that the trust money had been received by the firm in the course of its business , and reference was made to Agip .
\ tI have to confess that I can not see any reason in principle why a Barnes v. Addy type of accessory liability for breach of trust should not be at least capable of giving rise to vicarious liability in circumstances where a partner guilty of accessory liability has acted in the ordinary course of his partnership business .
That , however , is a familiar problem , or at any rate has become so since the landmark decision in Lloyd v. Grace Smith -LSB- 1912 -RSB- AC 716 .
Lloyd v. Grace Smith concerned the case of an employee , and a slightly earlier decision , Hamlyn v. John Houston & Co -LSB- 1903 -RSB- 1 KB 81 -LRB- CA -RRB- concerned the case of a partner .
In due course , Lloyd v. Grace Smith was also decided on the same ground , interpreting Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank -LRB- an authority which the House of Lords said had been misunderstood , see at 725 , 731 -RRB- as standing in the line of authorities going back to Holt CJ \ 's famous dictum in Hern v. Nichol -LRB- undated , c1700 -RRB- 1 Salk 289 that - `` for seeing that somebody must be a loser by this deceit , it is more reason that he that employs and puts a trust and confidence in the deceiver should be the loser than a stranger .
\ tThere is of course a line to be drawn between the Lloyd v. Grace Smith situation , where the employer has given the employee apparent authority to commit the tort , and the Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated -LSB- 1906 -RSB- AC 439 situation , where the servant has merely taken the opportunity afforded by his service to commit some wrong otherwise than in the course of doing that class of acts which he was employed to do : see Morris v. Martin -LSB- 1966 -RSB- 1 QB 716 at 727 , 737 , Armagas v. Mundogas -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 AC 717 .
In Lloyd v. Grace Smith Lord Macnaghten at 738/9 referred to the incidence of insurance as relevant to his considerations .
Examples of such full indemnities are cited , eg Lister v. Romford Ice and Cold Storage Company Ltd -LSB- 1957 -RSB- AC 555 , where Viscount Simonds and Lord Morton thought that an alternative route under which the employer could obtain a complete indemnity from its negligent employee was under the predecessor Act , the Law Reform -LRB- Married Women and Tortfeasors -RRB- Act 1935 -LRB- the `` Act of 1935 '' -RRB- : see at 579/580 and 584/5 .
`` Responsibility '' has been held to cover both causative potency and blameworthiness : Madden v. Quirke -LSB- 1989 -RSB- 1 WLR 702 at 707E , Downs v. Chappell -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 426 at 445H .
In any event , playing paymaster to the others was , as Mr Amhurst explained , the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai .
Given the arm-lock that Dubal had on Mr Livingstone in the form of a world-wide Mareva injunction , it may be that Mr Livingstone did not have all that much choice about what happened next : but the fact remains that Mr Livingstone decided not to defend his position , but to come to terms .
\ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 -LSB- Back -RSB- Note 12 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ xc2 \ xa0 \ x02 Mr Strothotte thought that he had been told by Mr Rich and Mr Green that the meeting also embraced Mr Al Tajir , but he was prepared to accept that he might have been mistaken about that .
In the end , however , it makes no difference , because the additional $ 85,000 is either properly to be attributed to Nillet , or , as Dubal \ 's points of claim and Mr Horat \ 's appendix 3 have recorded it , to Mr Salaam personally at Bank fur Handel .
I obtained that figure from para 6 of Mr Davis \ ' Outline Closing Submissions on behalf of the Salaam defendants , citing Mr Neal \ 's report at para 12 .
They appear to have been ignored on the ground that they related to the ASA and were paid by Clarendon .
Justice Carnwath : \ tOn 2nd March 1998 the Secretary of State presented a petition for the winding up of Market Wizard Systems -LRB- UK -RRB- Ltd -LRB- `` the Company '' -RRB- in the public interest .
In Walter L. Jacob and Co -LSB- 1989 -RSB- BCLC 345 , Nicholls LJ explained that the Court has to carry out a `` balancing exercise '' , and that , although the Court will be assisted by the evidence and submissions of the Secretary of State , supported by the expertise of his Department , it is ultimately to the Court that Parliament has entrusted the task of evaluating the evidence and deciding whether it affords sufficient reason for making a winding up order -LRB- p 353 -RRB- .
\ r \ n \ tIn early 1997 Mr Smith and his wife , on a visit to their daughter who was living and working in London , decided to open up a family business in London , which their daughter \ 's fianc \ xc3 \ xa9 , Mr Kevin Necessian , would run .
Because of difficulties in obtaining an extension of Mr Necessian \ 's work permit to enable him to run the business , he and Mr Smith \ 's daughter returned to Australia .
By this time Mr Smith had been introduced to Mr Wade , an English solicitor , and Mr Reichelt , who worked for him .
Mr Reichelt was described as `` general manager '' ; Mr Wade as company secretary and solicitor .
Further , for each additional \ xc2 \ xa350 ,000 , \ xc2 \ xa310 ,000 is required to be repaid to Arecki Pty Ltd. '' \ tThat was signed for Arecki by Mr Simpson , their financial controller and Mr Smith \ 's main financial adviser in Australia ; and for Market Wizard Systems UK Ltd by Mrs Smith .
\ r \ n \ tIn October Mr Reichelt had some discussions with Mr Cridland of Astwick and Co , with regard to the requirements of the FSA .
On 17th October Mr Wade confirmed that he was prepared to fulfil the role of compliance officer `` to oversee the sales procedures at -LRB- the Company -RRB- and to ensure compliance with the provisions of the FSA 1986 and the directions of Astwick and Co. '' Standard `` Compliance Forms '' were prepared for completion by sales staff , and checking by Mr Wade .
\ r \ n \ tThe Department \ 's enquiries began on 23rd October and their representatives interviewed Mr Reichelt and Mr Smith at the company \ 's premises on 23rd , 24th and 30th October .
Neither Mr Smith nor Mrs Smith were present at this interview , both being in Australia at the time .
\ r \ n \ tMr Day and Mr Smith had previously been involved in an ASC investigation with a company called Multivest System Pty Ltd , which offered computerised systems for trading in futures .
The Secretary of State submits that Mr Reichelt took part in or was concerned in the management of the company and that the company either had knowledge of that , or , in the person of Mr Smith , `` turned a blind eye '' to Mr Reichelt \ 's background .
I continued : `` The company \ 's response in more recent affidavits of Mr Robinson and Mr Reichelt , is to claim that his role is purely administrative , and that the management of the business has been carried out entirely by Mr Robinson .
\ tAlthough I was not aware of this when giving that judgment , Mr Robinson and Mr Reichelt were also involved at that time in the activities of a company called Interdata UK Ltd , which was promoting a computer programme called Alpha-XL , intended to assist customers in trading on the ordinary stock market .
In this Mr Robinson was shown as chairman and Mr Reichelt as `` general manager '' .
He had permission from the Department of Employment to be employed by Mr Wade as an `` international legal consultant '' .
The precise nature of the arrangements between Mr Wade and Mr Reichelt were not entirely clear from the evidence .
It seems that Mr Wade provided Mr Reichelt with a flat and living expenses , and additional payments which apparently varied according to what Mr Wade was able to pay .
\ r \ n \ tMr Wade and Mr Reichelt were introduced to Mr Smith in April 1997 by a business acquaintance .
According to Mr Reichelt , Mr Smith was aware of his previous involvement with Comstrad , but not that he was bankrupt or of the disqualification which went with it .
He did not mention Mr Reichelt \ 's bankrupt status to Mr Smith , because it did not appear to him to be of any importance , Mr Reichelt not being an officer of the company .
He regarded Mr Reichelt as `` a very smart man '' , with a good record as a lawyer and a businessman in Queensland .
\ r \ n \ tEven if one accepts Mr Reichelt \ 's evidence that he referred all management decisions to Mr Smith , it is quite clear in my view that he was at least `` concerned in the management '' in the sense explained in the authorities .
\ r \ n \ tPerhaps the clearest indication of Mr Reichelt \ 's central role is in relation to the `` compliance meetings '' which he attended with Mr Wade and Mr Cridland .
Thus for example in the minutes of the meeting on 3rd November it is recorded that - \ r \ n '' -LRB- Mr Reichelt -RRB- agreed that as general manager of MWS , in charge of office administration , he would undertake to implement recommended procedural changes and report any known breaches of agreed procedures to the compliance officer who would then decide if it was a matter which required specific reference to Astwick and company .
Yet it was to Mr Wade , Mr Reichelt and Mr Cridland , all of whom had been deeply involved with Comstrad and Interdata , that he deliberately entrusted the compliance aspects of his business .
\ r \ n \ tI find it difficult to understand why Mr Smith should have adopted this course particularly against the background of his difficulties with ASC in Australia .
Mr Reichelt and Mr Wade on the other hand I found to be unreliable witnesses .
They must have been well aware that Mr Smith , in view of his extensive business interests in Australia , required something more than an administrative clerk .
Unfortunately , Mr Smith was won over by Mr Wade , whom he saw as `` a lovely English gentleman ... a solicitor on The Strand '' .
There was an affidavit from Mr Simpson , who is Mr Smith \ 's financial adviser in Australia , but he also was not called .
The most recent information , provided to Mr Alexander by Mr Simpson in a letter of 12th June , shows a total of $ 561,591.53 , including payments by Mr Smith direct , by WSA and by Arecki Property Ltd .
Thus , the March 1998 balance sheet reproduced in the Official Receiver \ 's report shows net liabilities of \ xc2 \ xa3106 ,202.49 , while the balance sheet attached to Mr Alexander \ 's report , which had been prepared by Mr Simpson , showed an excess of liabilities over assets of \ xc2 \ xa3164 ,740 .
Mr Alexander \ 's view was that the balance sheet test was irrelevant because , as he put it : \ r \ n `` If the unsecured loans from Mr Smith personally in his Australian companies , which are not currently due or payable , were excluded from the balance sheet it would show an excess of assets over liabilities ... '' -LRB- report para 3.12 -RRB- .
\ tMr Smith \ 's response to these points was two-fold : first , any deficiencies in the company \ 's accounting records were due to the failures of the accountant , and could and would have been rectified before the first year \ 's accounts were audited , had the Secretary of State not intervened ; and , secondly , that even if the loans were not fully documented , there was no question of Mr Smith withdrawing the money which he had invested in the company , and that in practice it was perfectly capable of meeting its debts as they fell due .
Not to engage the services of Mr Reichelt or Mr Wade .
I would in any event be unwilling to accept the undertakings without some further evidence as to how the accounting deficiencies are going to be rectified , and who in the absence of Mr Reichelt and Mr Wade is going to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the company .
That was the view of SIB itself in the guidance it wrote regarding PII cover in its October 1994 report -LRB- quoted above -RRB- , viz - \ r \ n \ t `` Such notice may need to be given in the course of a case review , depending on what emerges ... '' \ tIn the meantime , JRA appear to have been confident in their own procedures : witness the fact that transfers appear to have been effected in the period between the KPMG report and the TSW letter , also what JRA wrote to Mr Mowbray on 19 December 1994 , viz \ r \ n \ t `` we have already carried out extensive internal reviews and have satisfied ourselves that , in our view , the majority of our investors have been given `` best advice '' ... '' Moreover , JRA were not moved to give notice by prior warnings , such as Lautro \ 's Enforcement Bulletin 14 , which spoke of `` the potential problem '' , or EB16 , which spoke to `` the size of the overall problem '' .
\ tIn Thorman v. New Hampshire Insurance Co -LRB- UK -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 7 complaints were made in 1976 against the plaintiff architects regarding cracking of brickwork .
The dispute between the parties arises out of the carriage of a cargo of fruit in the vessel Baltic Universal from Seattle and Port Canaveral to Rotterdam between December 1995 and January 1996 .
`` BALTIC UNIVERSAL '' - Bill of Lading ROT-6 16.12.95 at Seattle Bill of Lading ROT-7 16.12.95 at Seattle Bill of Lading PC-01 30.12.95 at Port Canaveral We are instructed on behalf of the subrogated underwriters -LRB- Allianz in Hamburg -RRB- of two consignments of pears and a consignment of grapefruit carried from Everett and Port Canaveral to Rotterdam on board the m.v .
Also on 9th January Waltons wrote to Mr. Baskerville appointing him as arbitrator on behalf of the applicants .
There followed some telephone conversations concerning parallel proceedings which had been commenced in the Netherlands which led Waltons to write to the Club again on 20th January in the following terms : '' \ tFurther to our recent telephone conversations we have received confirmation from Dr. Dolk that the proceedings commenced in the Netherlands were issued purely to protect time .
On 24th January the Club notified Waltons of the appointment of Mr. O \ ` Donovan as the respondents \ ' arbitrator and a few days later it provided a letter of undertaking by way of security for the claim in terms which were acceptable to Waltons as the applicants \ ' solicitors .
The Aghios Lazaros was employed to carry a cargo of oranges from Greece to Rotterdam and/or Hamburg under a charter which contained a clause paramount and an arbitration clause in these terms : '' \ tIf any dispute arises during the performance of this charterparty and can not be solved amicably , -LSB- the same -RSB- shall be referred to arbitration in London '' .
However , the broad approach of the Court of Appeal in the Nea Agrex case , and in particular the judgment of Lord Denning \ xc2 \ xa0M.R. , has been applied in many subsequent cases , the most notable of which for present purposes is Peter Cremer G.m.b.H .
That case concerned a contract of affreightment for the carriage of pipes from Port Kembla in New South Wales to Kuantan in Malaysia .
Mr. Parsons for the applicants in this case submitted that Judge Jack \ 's decision on this point was wrong and should not be followed .
Mr. Parsons submitted that whatever may be said about the letter of 9th January , the letter of 20th January did expressly call upon the Club to agree to the appointment of Mr. Baskerville and therefore did on any view expressly comply with the requirements of the Limitation Act .
If one of the parties fails to appoint an Arbitrator - either originally or by way of substitution - for two weeks after the other party having appointed his Arbitrator has sent the party making default notice by mail , cable or telex to make the appointment , the party appointing the third Arbitrator shall , after application from the party having appointed his Arbitrator , also appoint an Arbitrator on behalf of the party making default ... '' On 18 March 1992 , after some intervening correspondence , SAC replied : `` Concerning your initiation of arbitration , our clients do not wish any of the 3 gentlemen you have proposed to sit as sole Arbitrator and accordingly when you have effected an appointment of your clients \ ' arbitrator and given us due notification of the same we shall attend to the appointment of the Respondents \ ' arbitrator within 14 days thereafter in accordance with clause 15 ... On 3 April 1992 HFW informed SAC that they had appointed Mr Kazantzis as Roussos \ 's arbitrator , and on 6 April SAC replied to say that they had appointed Mr Newcomb as Willies \ 's arbitrator .
To that telex SAC replied by letter dated 21 May 1992 to Mr Kazantzis , with copies to Mr Newcomb and to HFW : `` We are in receipt of Messrs Holman Fenwick and Willan \ 's telex yesterday in which they purport to extend your appointment to cover any claims by a party identified as Ocean Laser Shipping Limited .
It appears from this letter that SAC had consulted their clients , Willie , about the purported claim of Ocean Laser .
`` The Memorandum of Agreement states in lines 1 to 2 that G Roussos Sons SA , of 1 Dimosthenous Street , Piraeus , Greece or company to be nominated hereinafter called the `` Buyer '' , have today bought Motor Vessel `` CELTIC AMBASSADOR '' .
Thus even after HFW had finally explained the basis of Ocean Laser \ 's joining with Roussos in making claim under the MOA , Willie continued to throw down their jurisdictional gauntlet .
However , having considered the Nea Agrex case , he concluded that he was not bound to follow Lord Denning \ 's view that a notice of request to appoint could be implied as well as express , since , even though it was in his view part of Lord Denning \ 's ratio decidendi , it was not , he thought , shared by the other members of the Court of Appeal .
On behalf of Willie , Mr Michael Nolan submitted precisely to the contrary : that Vosnoc was rightly decided and only an express request would suffice ; that in any event neither telex nor letter could be construed as an implied request , and that even if either of them would otherwise be construed as such , it could not take effect since it was addressed not to Willie but merely copied to Willie \ 's solicitors in the Roussos arbitration , SAC , who had no authority from Willie to receive a notice commencing a further arbitration on behalf of Ocean Laser ; and that the Limitation Act laid down the sole means by which an arbitration could be commenced .
Whether because he regarded himself as directly applying a statutory code , or because he was influenced by Mr Justice Kerr \ 's dictum in Surrendra Overseas Ltd v. Government of Sri Lanka -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR at 570 that `` For the purposes of limitation the commencement of an arbitration must be clear and unequivocal '' , a dictum strongly relied on by Mr Nolan before me , Judge Jack felt unable to give weight to those policy considerations .
This led Mr Berry to submit on behalf of Ocean Laser that an arbitration had been commenced by Ocean Laser against Willie in any event .
That began by express reference to Mr Kazantzis \ 's appointment on behalf of Roussos and thus by inference to the Roussos/Willie arbitration in which Willie had already appointed Mr Newcomb as their arbitrator .
In my judgment there can be no reasonable doubt that Willie were intended to regard this communication as a notice to respond by similarly appointing Mr Newcomb as their arbitrator in respect of Ocean Laser \ 's claims under the MOA as well as in respect of Roussos \ 's claims , and I have no doubt that that was how Willie in fact understood it , and rightly so .
In those terms , it was in theory possible , but I would have regarded it as eccentric to the point of unreasonableness , for Willie to have appointed a different arbitrator than Mr Newcomb .
The fact , therefore , that , by impliedly or in substance calling upon Willie to appoint Mr Newcomb in respect of Ocean Laser \ 's claims as well , Ocean Laser may have been applying the wrong formula in their invocation of arbitration , does not seem to me to matter at all : see Nea Agrex and Mannai , as well as The Petr Schmidt -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 202 at 207 per Potter J .
Or it may be that they were taking for granted that , unless they heard to the contrary , Willie would indeed recognise Mr Newcomb \ 's jurisdiction in respect of the Ocean Laser claim .
It is another to submit , as Mr Nolan does , that Willie did not know , or rather that it was reasonable for them not to have understood , that they were being requested , if they had not already done so , to appoint Mr Newcomb as their arbitrator in respect of the Ocean Laser claim as well .
If the question is whether it had been made reasonably clear to Willie that Ocean Laser had invoked against them a submission to arbitration in respect of their claim under the MOA and its arbitration clause , and that Willie were expected to respond to that invocation by themselves submitting that claim there and then - if they had not already done so - to the arbitral process , I find it impossible to say that that question should not be answered with a plain `` Yes '' .
If , as Lord Denning thought , a notice which says `` I require the difference between us to be submitted to arbitration '' is sufficient , then I can not see why Ocean Laser \ 's points of claim are not sufficient , - and a fortiori HFW \ 's letter in further explanation of why , in effect , Ocean Laser were entitled - and it would follow Willie were bound - to arbitrate .
Whether as a separate point or not , Mr Nolan also emphasised that the two documents were not addressed to Willie , or even to SAC , but only copied to the latter .
Such provisions , however , either precede , or in any event pay no regard to , modern means of communication such as telex or fax ; and when dealing with post require a registered letter to a `` place of abode '' in England and Wales .
However , the letter is written primarily on the assumption that Mr Newcomb had already become a member of the tribunal for Ocean Laser \ 's claim , but possibly means also that , if perchance he had not been , the explanation about Ocean Laser would lead to Willie \ 's confirmation of his appointment or their acquiescence in the tribunal \ 's jurisdiction .
For the purpose of his submission Mr Berry relied on two authorities , The Jordan Nicolov -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 Lloyd \ 's Rep 11 and Baytur SA v. Finagro Holding SA -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 134 , in both of which the new party claiming to enter upon an existing arbitration was an assignee of the claimant in that arbitration .
As it is , however , I have already decided that Ocean Laser had commenced arbitration against Willie in 1992 , and Mr Nolan was able to inform me , upon instructions , that if I so decided Willie would confirm Mr Newcomb as their arbitrator .
Lord Brandon of Oakbrook said -LRB- at 499E/G -RRB- : `` The argument in relation to the first contention was that the judgment of the Dutch Court of Appeal was procedural in nature , in that it consisted only of a decision that a Dutch court had no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the appellants \ ' claim , and did not pronounce in any way on the question whether the claim itself , or any substantive issue in it , if it were to be entertained and adjudicated on , would succeed or fail .
The matter was considered in Cargill v. Kadinopoulos -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 1 .
Lord Goff of Chieveley , with whose speech the other members of the House agreed , pointed out that the arbitrator \ 's decision had involved both findings of fact , as to whether circumstances had arisen as to whether he was called upon to exercise his discretion , and a decision as to how he should exercise that discretion .
Indeed , as Lord Justice Leggatt pointed out in the Court of Appeal , it would be unrealistic to hold otherwise .
-LSB- 3 -RSB- The question of what constitutes an award was also briefly visited , by coincidence on the very same day as Cargill v. Kadinopoulos was before the House of Lords , by Judge Diamond QC in The Trade Fortitude -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 Lloyd \ 's Rep 169 .

Kadinopoulos may support the view that I had tentatively expressed in James Lazenby & Co v. McNicholas Construction Co Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 WLR 615 at 630/1 to the effect that an award striking out a claim for want of prosecution under section 13A of the Arbitration Act 1950 would be a final determination of the claim .
b ` Introduction and facts In this action the plaintiff , Huyton S.A. -LRB- `` Huyton '' -RRB- , seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the defendant , Peter Cremer GmbH & Co. -LRB- `` Cremer '' -RRB- , from pursuing a claim which Cremer has referred to London arbitration by GAFTA .
The claim which Cremer wishes to arbitrate seeks to establish that demurrage under a sale contract entered into with Huyton should have been measured at a rate of $ 6,500 per day , rather than the $ 11,000 which Huyton insisted upon Cremer paying ; to establish further that it was not liable for all or at any rate the larger part -LRB- $ 49,000 -RRB- of the sum of $ 65,245.40 likewise paid at Huyton \ 's insistence , on account of guarantee expenses ; and to recover sums accordingly .
The factual background starts with the sale contract dated 13th September 1995 for the shipment and sale by Cremer as seller to Huyton as buyer of 30,000 mt Romanian milling wheat plus or minus 10 % at buyer \ 's option at $ 175 per mt FOB spout trimmed Constantza in September/October 1995 .
Cremer is based in Hamburg .
Huyton also had a pre-existing commitment , made 31st August 1994 , to sell to Sotisco Trading Company Limited -LRB- `` Sotisco '' -RRB- of Khartoum `` any origin milling wheat in sound good condition , crop 1993/1994 or 1994/1995 at sellers option at $ 225 per mt C+FFO Port Sudan '' .
Agrimpex on behalf of Huyton instructed its regular brokers , J. Gran & Partners Ltd. -LRB- `` JGP '' -RRB- of London , to charter a vessel to lift the wheat contracted to be shipped by Cremer .
It transpires that NBT was owned by Jens ran until February 1995 , when it was sold to Mr Gunnar Gran , a nephew of Mr Jens Gran , who until the end of 1995 worked for Messrs. Grieg , shipbrokers of Bergen .
These facts regarding NBT were unknown at any relevant time to Huyton as well as Cremer .
On the evidence of their own witness statements , neither Mr Lund nor Mr Gunnar Gran appears to have had an active conception of a broker \ 's duties of good faith and integrity .
Mr Gunnar Gran positively instructed Mr Lund to mislead Agrimpex , e.g .
At a demurrage rate of $ 11,000 a day , and allowing for holidays and other interruptions of time , Cremer \ 's liability for load port demurrage amounted to $ 496,840.97 , as set out in a calculation which was sent by Huyton to Cremer on about 18th December 1995 together with a copy of the charter between NBT and Huyton .
Cremer has never refunded the extra $ 36,666.67 to its Romanian seller or informed it of the discrepancy or , indeed , about the present claim against Huyton - the explanation which Mr Birkholz gave me being to the effect that Cremer wants to deal with everything at once , after concluding its claim against Huyton .
At about the same time Cremer \ 's shipping agent , Proline of Hamburg , sent a message to JGP , expressed to be `` on behalf of our principal ... which is presently the owner of the wheat on board of your good vsl '' and asking JGP to advise `` how the consignee will rcv the cargo , against presentation of first class bank guarantee ?? ''
On 29th December 1995 Cremer and Huyton received from Olympic notice of a claim to a lien in respect of freight and `` undisputed demurrage '' at Constantza of $ 316,468.75 due under Olympic \ 's charter with NBT .
The limited amount of demurrage claimed was of concern to Cremer , and was a factor in a developing belief that Huyton could not be trusted .
Accordingly , Cremer sought to obtain information from other sources about the actual charter position and rates , whilst telling Huyton no more than that it was checking figures or seeking documents .
In a further message to Huyton on 11th January , excusing its non-payment of demurrage , Cremer referred to the notices received from both Olympic and the vessel \ 's owners .
On 4th January 1996 , Sotisco complained to Huyton about the gluten content of the wheat , whilst acknowledging that the contract contained no express term regarding gluten , and ended : \ t `` Finally , pls be notified tht above cargo will be kept in silo at Port Sudan for your account own risk and expense till this quality dispute is finalized .
Huyton did not at this stage pass on Sotisco \ 's complaint to Cremer .
On 9th January 1996 Cremer presented shipping documents to Huyton \ 's bank , notifying Huyton that it had done so .
At 1722 hours Huyton also insisted once again that Cremer settle immediately the $ 496,840.97 claimed for loadport demurrage .
On 15th January 1996 Cremer \ 's administration department responded to Huyton \ 's message regarding demurrage : \ t `` Our legal department has indicated to us that we are indeed in no way partner to the owners and therefore herewith confirm that we will arrange remittance without any further delay .
The rest of the message , in so far as it seemed to acknowledge liability for the full sum claimed , appears now to have been incautiously expressed by Cremer \ 's administration department , since others responsible for the making and handling of this contract within Cremer were still very exercised by the unproven likelihood , as they perceived it , of a second voyage charter involving much lower loadport demurrage than that which Huyton was claiming from Cremer and a strong , though unproven suspicion that Huyton was trying to defraud Cremer .
Cremer asserted that the cargo had been `` accepted upon completion of discharge '' on 2nd January and that Huyton had thereby `` waived any right to reject the documents as presented to you on 10th January as well as to refuse to pay for the cargo received '' .
As to the documents presented , Cremer said that Huyton had also waived any discrepancies by failure to raise them within 48 hours , but that Cremer would without prejudice address them and revert in due course .
In reply on 17th January , Huyton insisted on its position and on rectification of the discrepancies before payment , saying that the rights to reject the goods and the documents were separate rights , and welcoming the fact that Cremer was addressing the discrepancies .
We have to present a fumigation certificate to our buyers in order to get paid and this is not a contract where we are obliged to accept a guarantee ... \ tOf course we will pay your documents when they conform to the contract -LRB- including our buyers being prepared to accept your non-conforming documents from us -RRB- ... '' In a message which appears effectively to have crossed with Huyton \ 's message at 1631 , Cremer at about 1622/24 on 18th January informed Huyton that as its deadline had passed without payment \ t '' ... we therefore will instruct -LSB- the bank -RSB- to immediately return the contract documents to us .
If you do this before close of business on 31st January , we will pay your invoice less the loadport demurrage -LRB- the amount of which we think you have actually agreed -RRB- and the costs we have incurred in establishing a guarantee for delivery of the goods without having the documents ... '' Cremer on 25th January supplied Huyton with a revised radiation certificate conforming with the contract terms .
In reply Huyton said that it was obvious that Cremer had taken legal advice , and set out the substance of legal advice which it said that it had taken supporting its position .
In response to Cremer \ 's message of 30th , Huyton on 31st said that it had no contract with Olympic .
It pointed out also that Olympic had only referred to the `` undisputed '' demurrage owed by NBT and ended by saying that Cremer had on 15th January accepted and said that it would meet Huyton \ 's demurrage claim .
By 31st January Cremer had supplied Huyton \ 's bank with a revised certificate of origin meeting the contract terms as well as a fumigation certificate .
Huyton still had some reservations about the documents being presented , but appears to have been prepared to waive any of its remaining objections even if valid , provided at least that Cremer agreed its other terms .
Cremer on 1st February denied that it had on 15th January agreed to meet Huyton \ 's full demurrage claim .
On 6th February Cremer said that it found Huyton \ 's attitude `` completely unreasonable '' , and that the simple facts were that \ t `` you have obtained delivery of the contract goods and you are refusing to pay the full contract price .
Huyton rejected Cremer \ 's stance and indicated that it would if necessary commence the present action to restrain pursuit of any such arbitration .
At one point , Huyton appeared to be trying to expand its scope to obtain a finding that the demurrage and guarantee charges were in fact due from Cremer to Huyton - a finding that if made would have effectively superseded the issue whether Cremer was entitled to pursue a claim in arbitration with regard to their deduction .
The true analysis is that Cremer must be regarded as having received payment of the price in full on first presentation of documents and as having accepted and satisfied in full a liability for the full amount of the demurrage and guarantee charges which Huyton claimed .
The unpleaded suggestion , made it seems for the first time in Mr Schaff \ 's skeleton , that Cremer could claim damages for breach or repudiation by Huyton in failing or refusing to pay the price prior to and on 23rd January 1996 is also unsustainable in circumstances where Cremer agreed to treat the presentation on 6th February as the first proper presentation .
But , before me , Mr Schaff did not suggest that the relief claimed by Huyton would be inappropriate or that the matter would still have to be left to the arbitrators , if I were to conclude that there was an agreement binding on and enforceable against Cremer , whereby Cremer agreed irrevocably to withdraw the demands which it presently wishes to pursue in arbitration against Huyton .
Mr Schaff raises a question mark over Huyton \ 's good faith in statements made that the goods were at Cremer \ 's disposal - particularly Huyton \ 's statement on 26th January 1996 that the goods removed from Port Sudan had been returned there , and Huyton \ 's reiteration on 2nd February 1996 that , if no agreement was reached , the goods `` will be at your disposal '' .
It is evident , from the inaccurate information provided both to Huyton by Sotisco on 4th January and to Cremer by its local contact on 30th January 1996 , that reliable information may be difficult to come by from the Sudan , and Sotisco at least may have its own motives for not keeping Huyton accurately informed .
Although it is true that Mr Philippas was vague about the precise sources of his information , and although the return of goods to Port Sudan from the interior would appear to have involved a substantial exercise , I am unable to conclude on the material before me that Mr Philippas was not repeating what he had been told and believed or that he was seeking deliberately to mislead Cremer , when he said on 26th January that the goods removed had been returned to Port Sudan and when he indicated on other occasions that the goods could and would , if necessary , be held at Cremer \ 's disposal .
This conclusion appears to me consistent also with the reasoning in Maskell v. Horner -LSB- 1915 -RSB- 3 K.B .
106 -LRB- see below -RRB- and with the treatment of the present problem in Goff and Jones on Restitution -LRB- Fourth Ed .
in Maskell v. Horner at p. 118 as being a payment -LRB- or concession -RRB- made `` voluntarily to close the transaction '' , rather than `` under compulsion of urgent and compelling necessity '' .
Mr Schaff \ 's primary contention is that Huyton broke or threatened to break the contract with Cremer by refusing to pay the price .
Cremer \ 's pleaded case is that Huyton accepted the goods and incurred liability for the price as a result of -LRB- i -RRB- the delivery of the goods ex-ship , -LRB- ii -RRB- Huyton \ 's communication to Cremer of a quality and condition claim on 12th January based upon alleged liability to its sub-buyers and -LRB- iii -RRB- the removal of part of the goods to the interior .
If that is wrong , he submits that Huyton was obliged to pay the price against presentation of the shipping documents and wrongfully failed to do so ; it thus became liable to Cremer , not strictly for the price , but for damages measured by reference to the contractual price under s. 50 .
Further alternatives which Mr Schaff sought to develop before me were that Huyton incurred , but refused to acknowledge , a liability , which was in economic terms the equivalent of the price , either in restitution or in damages on account of its retention and/or failure to return the goods to Cremer .
Taking first the contention that property passed , Mr Schaff accepts that the contract between Cremer and Huyton started lift as a contract providing for payment cash against documents .
Mr Schaff submits however that the effect of what actually occurred was to pass property either on delivery of the wheat ex ship , or , alternatively , on or about 15th January 1996 when Cremer asserted that the cargo had been `` accepted upon completion of discharge '' on 2nd January and that Huyton had thereby `` waived any right to reject the documents as presented to you on 10th January as well as to refuse to pay for the cargo received '' , and set a time limit for payment .
This is particularly so , having regard to the provision in Cremer \ 's contract with Huyton whereby shipped weight , quality , condition , description , sampling and analysis were to be final as certified on loading .
The most that can be said is that Cremer ascertained , through enquiry of JGP , that an arrangement for discharge and delivery was being made between the `` receivers '' and the vessel , that Cremer would or could have deduced from clause 45 of the charter -LRB- to which Cremer was not party -RRB- that Huyton would be providing -LRB- as it did -RRB- a letter of indemnity for this purpose , and that Cremer did not protest or react .
Cremer was not , therefore , itself party to any arrangement made with the owners of the Mike K for discharge and delivery without production of the bill of lading at Port Sudan , still less to any variation of the provision for payment CAD in its contract with Huyton .
Cremer was not aware that any wheat would be removed from Port Sudan , and Mr Carroux \ 's evidence , for what it may be worth on such a point , was that Cremer would have expected the wheat to be retained in Port Sudan for Cremer \ 's account .
Mr Philippas \ 's evidence was that Huyton was not aware that any cargo had been removed from Port Sudan , until the latter half of January 1996 -LRB- as far as he could recall not until Cremer informed Huyton on 25th January 1996 of its information to this effect , whereupon Huyton then checked with its own sources and was informed , albeit erroneously , that the goods had in fact been returned to the port -RRB- .
Mr Birkholz did not insist on payment immediately after discharge , because he knew that Cremer had still to tender shipping documents .
I would add , though not essential to my conclusion , that it was also , I think , foreseeable that Huyton would be on-selling on documentary terms , and that the presentation of shipping documents might continue to be of importance to Huyton for this reason , even though Cremer does not appear to have had particular knowledge that Huyton would require them under a letter of credit which Sotisco was in fact required to open .
That , as it happens , corresponds with the way in which Cremer evidently saw the matter until Huyton began to point out deficiencies in the documents .
It also corresponds with that aspect of Mr Schaff \ 's submissions , which rightly acknowledged the existence of a continuing contractual obligation on the part of Cremer -LRB- despite the delivery of the goods and other circumstances upon which Mr Schaff relied as making Huyton liable to pay the price -RRB- to present conforming documents to Huyton at some later stage .
But the recognition of such an obligation itself indicates that the contractually agreed documentation can not be regarded as being for the unilateral benefit of Cremer , and the suggestion that Huyton had to pay for the goods without receiving the documents , leaving it with an unsecured claim for damages if the documents subsequently proved not to match the contractual requirements , does not strike me as probable .
Mr Males sought to turn this improbability to Huyton \ 's advantage in a different way , by contending that the passing of property was irrelevant , and of no assistance to Cremer in any event , because it should be regarded as only passing contingently on proper contractual documentation being subsequently presented , so that , if and when Huyton later validly terminated the contract for failure or refusal to present such documentation , the rejection would revest property and remove any right to the price .
That case can not be sustained in relation to the period up to 19th and 23rd January 1996 , the dates on which first Huyton and then Cremer purported to treat the sale contract as at an end .
On the contrary , Cremer was insisting that it did not have to present conforming documents and that Huyton was obliged to pay the full price without conforming documents .
Mr Schaff contends that Cremer \ 's attitude in the exchanges which led to Huyton \ 's claim to treat Cremer as in repudiation was not repudiatory .
Cremer was purporting to set Huyton a deadline , failing compliance with which Cremer indicated that it would obtain return of the documents from its bank .
The matter must be viewed objectively and Mr Philippas \ 's answer in cross-examination that Huyton thought from Cremer \ 's message of 18th January 1996 that Cremer wanted the documents back on 18th January 1996 in order to correct and represent them to Huyton seems to me both unlikely to reflect accurately what Huyton understood at the time , and in any event to be irrelevant on the question what Cremer indicated objectively .
Cremer was categorically denying Huyton \ 's entitlement to such documents , and was itself laying down deadlines for a quite different character of performance to any agreed between the parties .
In my judgment , Huyton was entitled to treat Cremer \ 's attitude as repudiatory .
Mr Schaff submits that , if that was so , Huyton was obliged to restore to Cremer the goods of which it had received delivery through its sub-buyers , and that , since Huyton did not do so , its purported acceptance of Cremer \ 's repudiation was ineffective , and it was liable for the price of the goods received either as a matter of contract or on a quantum meruit .
Once Huyton had determined the contract , it was its duty to hold and , so far as necessary , make the goods available for Cremer .
I accept that this would involve making them available at Port Sudan so far as they had been removed from Port Sudan by Huyton \ 's sub-buyers .
Mr Schaff points out that Huyton did not mention the goods in its message of termination on 19th January or until its further message of 25th January , sent after Cremer \ 's response of 23rd January which referred yet again to the delivery of the goods to Huyton .
What Huyton had to make clear was that it was treating Cremer as in repudiation , and , if it did this , the automatic effect in law was to oblige Huyton to put the goods of which it had received delivery at Cremer \ 's disposal at Port Sudan , whether or not Huyton expressly adverted to that effect in its termination notice .
Further , once Cremer made a further reference to the delivery of the goods in its reply on 23rd January , Huyton did on 25th January confirm that the goods were at Cremer \ 's disposal .
In the meantime , Huyton had no duty to take any positive steps such as re-shipping them , and Cremer itself did not request Huyton for information or assistance with a view to their recovery , or take any steps in that direction , except for enquiries as the goods \ ' whereabouts made through local agents and except in so far as recovery of the goods may have been part of the thinking behind Cremer \ 's request to the bank to return the shipping documents .
Recovery of the goods must in fact always have appeared to Cremer to be a most unattractive option , whether or not they were at Port Sudan .
Further , as a matter of fact , the evidence does not satisfy me that the goods could not and would not have been held at Cremer \ 's disposal , and so far as necessary returned to Port Sudan for this purpose , had Cremer so insisted and had the parties not reached the arrangement which they did on 6th/7th February 1996 .
The probability is in my view that Mr Philippas of Huyton meant and believed what he said when he indicated on 25th January 1996 and subsequently that the goods were at Cremer \ 's disposal , although Huyton \ 's message of 25th January suggests that he also hoped that it would be possible to persuade Cremer to reach an accommodation .
In answers to interrogatories sworn unsatisfactorily by an employee of Huyton in Switzerland , who appears to have had no direct knowledge of affairs and who Mr Philippas said had not contacted him about the answers , it was stated categorically that Huyton had not given notice to Sotisco that the goods should not be used .
If Huyton \ 's stance in purporting to terminate for breach by Cremer was unjustified , then Cremer \ 's termination was on its face valid , and , since the property had not passed , entitled Cremer to recover possession of the goods .
Had Cremer shown that Huyton could not return the goods , Cremer could no doubt have acquired a restitutionary right or a right in damages ; the measure of recovery might then have related to the value of the goods in the Sudan rather than the contract price , although there is in fact no evidence which would enable any positive conclusion as to what , if any , difference , might exist between these two .
The result is that Cremer had no continuing right after 19th or alternatively 23rd January 1996 either to present conforming documents and to claim payment of the price or , if it be material , to require payment of the price or any equivalent sum by Huyton on any other basis .
One is left with an agreement made because Cremer found itself faced with a situation where it was unattractive to seek to recover the goods in the Sudan , and to dispose of them there or elsewhere .
In the absence of any illegitimate pressure from Huyton to make that arrangement , there is no basis for avoiding the arrangement , and Huyton is entitled to relief preventing Cremer from pursuing an arbitration in breach of it .
There are at least two possibilities , arising , as I have already indicated , from Cremer \ 's case as to the effect of the discharge and delivery of the goods to Huyton \ 's sub-buyers , the removal of goods from the port and/or Cremer \ 's decision to treat the goods as belonging to Huyton and to treat the price as due prior to presentation of the shipping documents .
On either basis , Huyton \ 's purported acceptance on 19th January 1996 of a repudiation by Cremer was ineffectual , but Huyton was thereby itself in repudiation which Cremer accepted on 23rd January .
On the latter scenario , since property never passed , Cremer \ 's acceptance of Huyton \ 's repudiation left Cremer with the property in the goods , but also with a claim against Huyton to make good any difference between the value of the goods realisable after their recovery in the Sudan and the contract price .
Cremer \ 's case that Huyton applied illegitimate pressure inducing Cremer to make the agreement of 6th/7th February is based expressly on the former scenario .
But Mr Schaff \ 's submissions also embraced the latter scenario , on the footing , in effect , that Huyton could , upon that scenario , be regarded as applying illegitimate pressure , by its assertion that it was Cremer who was in breach and by its disclaimer of any responsibility for the contract price at any stage , whether as such or , after Cremer \ 's acceptance of Huyton \ 's repudiation , as a measure of liability for wrongful refusal to accept and pay for the goods .
Leaving aside for the moment questions of onus , it must at least be the case that Huyton applied illegitimate pressure and that such pressure was a significant cause inducing Cremer to make the agreement of 6th/7th February 1996 .
Mr Schaff submits that , if Huyton \ 's position could now be seen to have been unjustified , it must follow that Huyton applied illegitimate pressure on Cremer -LRB- in which case , he submits , the only remaining issue would be causative inducement -RRB- .
This is contrasted in Goff and Jones on The Law of Restitution -LRB- 4th ed .
The relevant authority in the latter context is Barton v. Armstrong -LSB- 1976 -RSB- AC 104 -LRB- P.C. .
The majority referred at p. 118H to the principle that `` Once make out that there has been anything like deception , and no contract resting in any degree on that foundation can stand '' , and said at p. 119A : \ t `` Their Lordships think that the same rule should apply in cases of duress and that if Armstrong \ 's threats were `` a '' reason for Barton \ 's executing the deed he is entitled to relief even though he might well have entered into the contract if Armstrong had uttered no threats to induce him to do so .
After reviewing the facts , the majority then said at p. 120 : \ t `` If Barton had to establish that he would not have made the agreement but for Armstrong \ 's threats , then their Lordships would not dissent from the view that he had not made out his case .
On the contrary it was for Armstrong to establish , if he could , that the threats which he was making and the unlawful pressure which he was exerting for the purpose of inducing Barton to sign the agreement and which Barton knew were being made and exerted for this purpose in fact contributed nothing to Barton \ 's decision to sign .
that though it may be that Barton would have executed the documents even if Armstrong had made no threats and exerted no unlawful pressure to do so , the threats and unlawful pressure in fact contributed to his decision to sign the documents and to recommend their execution by Landmark and the other parties to them .
Professor Birks in An Introduction to the Law of Restitution -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , pp.182-3 has suggested that , in cases such as Pao On v. Lau Yiu -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 614 where relief was refused on the ground that there had been `` commercial pressure but no coercion '' -LRB- p. 635 -RRB- , the court was , in effect , insisting `` on a more severe test of the degree of compulsion than is found in Barton v. Armstrong '' , securing what he describes as `` a concealed discretion to distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable , legitimate and illegitimate applications of this species of independently unlawful pressure '' .
The approach there adopted by McHugh J.A. , at p. 45 , was based on statements by the House of Lords in DPP v. Lynch -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 653 , to the effect that , in cases of duress , `` the will -LSB- is -RSB- deflected , not destroyed '' .
in Crescendo assumed that it would be reversed in accordance with the principle applied by the Privy Council in Barton v. Armstrong .
Leaving aside cases of fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation , mentioned in Barton v. Armstrong , the law normally treats the party seeking relief in respect of a breach of contract or seeking to set aside a bargain on grounds , such as innocent misrepresentation , as under a legal onus to prove his case on causation .
Turning now to the facts of the present case , the evidence called by Cremer , from Mr Birkholz in particular , was that Cremer felt under extreme and increasing pressure during the period leading up to the agreement of 6th/7th February .
It suspected , according to Mr Birkholz \ 's witness statement and evidence , that the Huyton/NBT document was not a genuine charter , that it had been brought into existence for the purpose of brining a demurrage claim against Cremer at a higher rate , and that Huyton was trying to defraud Cremer .
-LRB- b -RRB- \ tMr Birkholz was concerned at the quality claim which Huyton raised on 12th January , and his `` distrust was confirmed '' when three days later Huyton raised an issue of discrepancies of documents .
-LRB- c -RRB- \ tCremer -LRB- rightly -RRB- did not believe the information relayed to it -LRB- innocently -RRB- by Huyton on 25th January to the effect that the part of the cargo removed inland had been returned to Port Sudan .
In these circumstances , Cremer did not believe that Huyton was holding or capable of holding the goods at its disposal , as Huyton said on and after 25th January that it was doing ; and therefore distrusted Huyton on this basis too .
-LRB- d -RRB- \ tAfter the dispute arose whether Huyton was bound to pay without Cremer presenting conforming documents , and both parties claimed to have terminated the contract , Cremer found itself in a situation where the goods were in the Sudan , and it had a choice between -LRB- i -RRB- continuing to pursue a claim to the price , if necessary by arbitration , or -LRB- ii -RRB- accepting Huyton \ 's stance and reclaiming the goods or -LRB- iii -RRB- reaching some compromise .
-LRB- e -RRB- \ tMr Birkholz said that in this situation he became very scared ; it was `` alarming '' to have Huyton as a buyer ; his witness statement described Huyton as a `` front '' for Agrimpex , and suggested that , at the start of negotiations , Cremer had thought it would be dealing with Agrimpex , but was happy to proceed with Huyton because Huyton was related to Agrimpex .
What Mr Amaslidis learned from Mr Jens Gran revealed that one of JGP \ 's employees , Mr Lund , had broken Agrimpex \ 's policy regarding voyage charters .
Agrimpex and Huyton remained ignorant of the much more serious breaches of duty , which can now be seen to have taken placed between Mr Lund and Mr Gunnar Gran , directed against Huyton \ 's interests , as well as ignorant of the family relationship between JGP and NBT -LRB- which itself would no doubt have raised questions -RRB- .
In parenthesis , it now also seems clear , from the facts recounted at the beginning of this judgment and from JGP \ 's documents obtained under subpoena by Cremer , that Mr Lund and Mr Gunnar Gran -LRB- and I have to say that it seems from his signature of certain false addenda , although he did not give evidence before me , quite likely also Mr Jens Gran -RRB- would have gone to considerable lengths to put Huyton off the scent , had Huyton sought to investigate further , so that it is unclear that any further attempts to obtain the head voyage charter or to investigate further would at that stage have led anywhere .
The limited demurrage for which Olympic claimed a lien on 29th December 1995 was also not a matter on which Mr Amaslidis focused , or indeed , a matter which Cremer - co-addressee of Olympic \ 's notice - raised with Huyton for another month .
On 30th January and 1st February 1996 , Cremer did for the first time disclose concerns about the demurrage in the form of an assertion - not based on more than suspicion , and not in fact correct - that Huyton was party to a charter at lower rates than those claimed from Cremer .
Viewing the matter on the basis that Huyton knew that Mr Lund had breached Huyton \ 's internal policy but were as much deceived as anyone about JGP \ 's and NBT \ 's wider misconduct and deception , I do not think that Mr Schaff \ 's criticism of Huyton \ 's conduct , as objectively unreasonable , can be sustained .
It would not be right , in my view , to treat Huyton as in effect responsible for Cremer \ 's suspicion either arising or persisting .
Cremer \ 's final concerns , when Huyton passed on a quality claim and then raised the question of discrepancies , do not seem to me to have been objectively based on anything that Huyton actually did or said .
Cremer evidently viewed Huyton as misleading it about the location of the part of the goods originally moved .
If Huyton was being dishonest about what was happening to the goods , the risk that Huyton intended that Cremer should get neither the price nor the goods must have seemed very large .
In fact , however , Huyton was not being dishonest , and I am not satisfied that the goods could not and would not have been returned to Cremer \ 's custody , at Port Sudan , had Cremer really ever wanted this .
As to -LRB- c -RRB- , the views expressed in Mr Birkholz \ 's witness statement about Huyton \ 's position as a `` front '' were not justified in evidence , but they may again have represented the sort of thinking to which Cremer fell prey at the time , although it was , so far as appears , unjustified .
Taking next -LRB- e -RRB- , Cremer \ 's fears about Huyton \ 's status , financial and otherwise , appear to have developed ex post facto , after the dispute arose .
This contract was in fact made against a background of previous contracts which Huyton -LRB- as distinct , it appears , in one case from Cremer -RRB- had performed entirely satisfactorily , even though none had been as large as this .
Cremer was , I find , perfectly happy at the outset of the present contract to deal with Huyton .
The reality , in my judgment , is that Cremer would not have wished to have the goods back in the Sudan in any event , if it could avoid that .
Mr Schaff said that this was a situation where illegitimate pressure by Huyton , in the form of a threat not to pay the price even though it or its equivalent was due , left Cremer with no option but to accept Huyton \ 's terms .
Mr Birkholz said that Cremer was confident in its position that the price was due .
It is not suggested that Cremer faced any overwhelming or unduly onerous financial burden having to carry the $ 5 million until it succeeded in arbitration , assuming that Huyton could and would then have paid any such sum which Cremer was awarded .
But that concern was , it seems to me , substantially generated by matters for which Huyton had no responsibility , and which lay outside any refusal by Huyton to make such payment - such as Cremer \ 's perception that Huyton was an untrustworthy front , based in turn on Cremer \ 's belief that Huyton was deceiving it about demurrage and the whereabouts of the goods .
This thinking too is not borne out by the actual facts , as they are now known , and , once again , it was Cremer \ 's mistaken perception of what Huyton was doing , rather than the actual or threatened breach by non-payment itself , which in this situation , in my judgment , played the most powerful role in Cremer \ 's decision to accept the compromise .
Further , it was a claim in relation to which Huyton had some reason to look askance at Cremer \ 's attitude , particularly in the light of Cremer \ 's apparent concession on 15th January that it would pay the demurrage in full ; as I have indicated , that message was in fact probably an ill-phrased message prepared by Cremer \ 's administration department with nothing more than the lien claims in mind , but Huyton had at the time no reason to know this .
Only on 30th January did Cremer raise any explicit query about demurrage , and on 1st February Cremer sought to support this by asserting that it had , subsequently to 15th January , itself received information that Huyton was charging Cremer an amount more than Huyton had actually had to pay under its own charterparty .
As far as Huyton was concerned this was simply untrue -LRB- and in fact , although Huyton did not actually know this , it was not even true that Cremer had received information to that effect -RRB- .
It seems to me that , against this background , it is understandable that Huyton should decide that it was not prepared to have anything more to do with the matter , if Cremer was going to pursue its points on demurrage and charges .
Huyton was giving up an arguable case that the goods were now Cremer \ 's responsibility , and it seems to me that it was entitled , before so doing , to look at this other contractual dispute , raised with it late in the day , and to insist on its final resolution as part of an overall arrangement .
I come back to the question whether , assuming that Huyton did commit an actual and threatened breach of contract in refusing to pay the price , the agreement which was reached on 6th/7th February 1996 was induced , or Cremer \ 's will was deflected , in any significant way by such breach - as opposed , for example , to Cremer \ 's own perception of the merits and demerits of alternative courses open to it , influenced to a major extent by Cremer \ 's mistaken perceptions about Huyton \ 's conduct and intentions .
I note that in Barton , in addition to a number of incidents when Armstrong was undoubtedly responsible for threats to Barton \ 's life and safety , there was an incident in which a man called Vojinovic informed Barton that he had been hired by Armstrong to kill Barton , with which the majority in the Privy Council dealt as follows : \ t `` It is true that the judge was not satisfied that Vojinovic had been employed by Armstrong but if one man threatens another with unpleasant consequences if he does not act in a particular way , he must taken the risk that the impact of his threats may be accentuated by extraneous circumstances for which he is not in fact responsible .
That statement was however related to extraneous circumstances , for which Barton had no more responsibility than Armstrong .
I think that a court should take that into account , and in effect put such misconceptions aside , when considering the sufficiency and significance of any causal link between any illegitimate pressure applied by Huyton and Cremer \ 's reaction .
Even assuming that a conclusion that Huyton was in breach or threatened breach of contract imposes on Huyton an initial factual onus to show that Cremer was not thereby caused to enter into the agreement of 6th/7th February 1996 , it seems to me that , once Cremer \ 's misconceptions are taken into account , the onus shifts to Cremer to show that it would still have entered into that agreement , aside from such misconceptions , simply on the basis of Huyton \ 's breach or threatened breach of contract .
But an important reason for Cremer \ 's strength of feeling and for its actual decision to accede to Huyton \ 's demands was Cremer \ 's -LRB- erroneous -RRB- perception that Huyton was acting in bad faith towards it .
It seems to me that Cremer would in likelihood have acted in one or other of the following two ways : -LRB- i -RRB- Either Cremer would simply have stuck to its stated position , refusing to enter any such agreement as that of 6th/7th February 1996 , and would have pursued Huyton in arbitration for the price or damages measured by reference to the price , unless Huyton took a less rigid line .
On this basis , it was not any illegitimate pressure applied by Huyton , but Cremer \ 's misconceptions , which led to the agreement now challenged .
-LRB- ii -RRB- Alternatively , if one assumes that Cremer would still have made the agreement which it did , it would have done so not because the course identified in -LRB- i -RRB- would not have been practical if Cremer could have been assured of its success , but because -LRB- a -RRB- Cremer would have had well in mind , in relation to an unusual and complex dispute , that it could be wrong and that , if this proved to be so , its position in respect of the goods and the market might by then really be prejudiced , and/or because -LRB- b -RRB- at the end of the day Cremer was neither commercially nor financially greatly affected either way by the deduction on account of demurrage and guarantee expenses on which Huyton was insisting .
On this hypothesis , although Cremer would not have entered into the agreement but for Huyton \ 's actual or threatened breach of contract , it could not , in my judgment , show that the pressure applied by Huyton deflected its will or constituted a sufficiently significant cause of the agreement for it to be unconscionable for Huyton to rely on the agreement .
In the result Cremer \ 's defences to this action fail on the basis that -LRB- a -RRB- by the agreement dated 6th/7th February 1996 Cremer agreed irrevocably to withdraw the demands which it now seeks to pursue in arbitration against Huyton and -LRB- b -RRB- this agreement binds Cremer .
It binds Cremer , because there was no illegitimate pressure , since Huyton never owed the price or its equivalent .
But , for the reasons I have given , even if there had been illegitimate pressure , Cremer \ 's case on economic duress should still , I believe , have failed , on the ground that there was no sufficient deflection of will or no sufficiently significant causal link - between such pressure and the agreement - to make it unconscionable for Huyton to insist on the agreement .
Dubal alleges that he gave no consideration and that the money was paid by a company then called Marc Rich & Co AG -LRB- `` Richco '' -RRB- as part of a dishonest scheme hatched , inter alios , by Dubal \ 's chief executive , Mr. Ian Livingstone , under which Richco pre-bought Dubal \ 's aluminium at a discounted price and in return provided finance in a very large sum for the construction of a fourth potline , all on what are said to be disadvantageous terms to Dubal .
\ t \ tThe background to these claims , at any rate so far as they involve other parties such as Mr. Livingstone and Richco and their participation in the Richco Consultancy Agreement , may be found in Dubai Aluminium Company Limited v Salam -LRB- unreported , 17 July 1998 -RRB- .
\ tThis doctrine , or exception to the general rule of legal professional privilege , is exemplified in a number of decisions such as R v Cox -LRB- 1884 -RRB- 14 QBD 153 , Williams v Quebrada Railway Land & Copper Co -LSB- 1895 -RSB- 2 Ch 751 , and more recently in Barclays Bank PLC v Eustace -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 WLR 1238 .
\ t \ tIn R v Cox at 167 , Stephen J said referring Lord Bougham \ 's judgment in Greenough v Gaskell 1 My & K 98 , that \ t \ t `` The reason on which the rule -LSB- of privilege -RSB- is said to rest can not include the case of communications , criminal in themselves , or intended to further any criminal purpose for the protection of such communications can not be possible otherwise than injurious to the interests of justice and to those of the administration of justice .
It would seem that the concept of iniquity covers `` crime or fraud '' -LRB- R v Cox at 165 -RRB- , the `` criminal or unlawful '' -LRB- Bullivant v A-G for Victoria -LSB- 1901 -RSB- AC 196 at 201 -RRB- and `` all forms of fraud and dishonesty such as fraudulent breach of trust , fraudulent conspiracy , trickery and sham contrivances '' -LRB- Crescent Farm -LRB- Sidcup -RRB- Sports Limited v Sterling Offices Limited -LSB- 1972 -RSB- 2 Ch 553 at 565 : see Barclays Bank v Eustace at 1249CD per Schiemann LJ -RRB- .
\ t \ tThe matters complained of in the present case , based upon Dubal \ 's own evidence , and the very detailed information there found about Mr. Al Alawi \ 's bank , credit card and telephone accounts , including the admission made by Dubal \ 's solicitor , Mr. Cranston , in his third affidavit , that information in relation to certain of Mr. Al Alawi \ 's accounts had been obtained by a sub-agent instructed by Page Associates making what Mr .
It is submitted that such information was by its nature confidential , and that access to it was unauthorised ; that other than the reference to such pretext calls , no explanation had been provided as to how it had been provided as to how it had been obtained , and that in the circumstances very strong inferences were to be drawn that the information had been obtained by means of false representation and impersonation , and that criminal offences had been committed , either in England under the Data Protection Act 1984 or in Switzerland under the banking secrecy laws there in force .
Indeed , Mr. Pelling , who appears for Dubal , has not been concerned to answer Mr. Al Alawi \ 's complaints on the facts , but rather has taken a stand in principle to which I will refer below .
In the circumstances , while I do not think that Mr. Pelling accepts the strictures made , and I am certainly in no position to find exactly what has been done or whether Dubal \ 's solicitors or Page Associates themselves had foreknowledge of such matters , nevertheless I believe that I can find there to be a strong prima facie case of criminal or fraudulent conduct in the obtaining of such information concerning Mr. Al Alawi \ 's accounts , and indeed in the light of Mr. Pelling \ 's approach to his submissions I think I can proceed for present purposes on the assumption that such conduct has occurred .
\ t \ tFor the purposes of his second submission , Mr. Pelling cited the well-known case of Karuma v R -LSB- 1955 -RSB- AC 197 .
In this connection the extracts that I have cited above from R v Cox at 167 appear to me to lend support to my conclusion .
These included several persons based in Latvia , but also several based in London , including solicitors who were partners or employees of Watson Farley & Williams -LRB- `` WFW '' -RRB- , persons who were officers or employees of Latmar Services Ltd. -LRB- `` Latservices '' -RRB- , an English company with offices in London , and a Mr. Henriksen , a Norwegian ship broker operating through a Bermuda service company but with offices in England -LRB- as well as himself having a home here -RRB- .
It has a bank account with Hambros Bank in London which it opened in connection with the contracts .
On 8 September WFW faxed to Ms Potts of Capco a letter asking her to see to the passing of board resolutions in terms sent to her , and the execution of a power of attorney also in terms supplied .
The evidence includes a statement by Ms Potts , apparently prepared in connection with related proceedings in France , which explains in some detail how the company was set up and operated , demonstrating the care that was taken to ensure that decisions on the part of Latreefers were taken either by the board or by someone duly authorised by the board , so as to emphasise the independent corporate personality of Latreefers .
Mr. Lax , of Latreefers \ ' solicitors Lawrence Graham , says that it had been intended that the money needed to pay the instalments would come from a loan by a German bank , Hamburgischer Landesbank , and that in the meantime funds would be provided from elsewhere in the group .
359 of 1987 -RRB- -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch 210 -LRB- also know , less enigmatically , as International Westminster Bank plc v. Okeanos Maritime Corporation , and to which I will refer as the Okeanos case -RRB- the statement of the relevant principles has evolved to the point at which they were summarised , most recently , by Knox J in Re Real Estate Development Co -LSB- 1991 -RSB- BCLC 210 , at 217 , as consisting of three core requirements , as follows : \ r \ n -LRB- 1 -RRB- \ tThere must be a sufficient connection with England and Wales which may , but does not necessarily have to , consist of assets within the jurisdiction .
\ r \ n Sufficient connection with England and Wales Mr. Moss Q.C .
If there is a clear and substantial connection with some other jurisdiction , it may be that more is needed by way of a connection with England and Wales for it to suffice as the foundation of the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction .
However , in the present case , Mr. Moss submits that connections with other jurisdictions are no more substantial , and certainly the connection with the country of incorporation , Liberia , which on first principles might have the best claim to be the jurisdiction to govern insolvency , is almost non-existent .
\ r \ n \ tHe points out that the contracts are between a Liberian buyer and a Polish shipbuilder , that much or most of the negotiation took place in Poland and Latvia , that the obligations under the contract , both of the Yard to design , build and deliver , and of Latreefers to pay , were to be performed in Poland , and that the management of the company , in terms of the operations of the board , took place in the Isle of Man .
\ r \ n \ tIn my judgment , the connecting factors with England and Wales , while not so strong as in the case before Peter Gibson J , are sufficient as a basis for assuming jurisdiction over this foreign corporation , and no other jurisdiction is more appropriate to wind up the company .
I note also that , in Bell Group Finance -LRB- Pty -RRB- Ltd. v. Bell Group Holdings Ltd -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 BCLC 304 , admittedly a case concerning an English company , but one where it was argued that there was no point in making an order since there were no available assets and no other reasonable possibility of benefit for the petitioning creditors , because any assets would be swallowed up by the secured creditors , Chadwick J used cases such as Re Compania Merabello , Re Eloc and the Okeanos case by way of analogy to justify making a winding-up order in order to allow an investigation of whether there were grounds for attacking the bank \ 's security .
I am satisfied that there is a sufficient connection with England and Wales and that the petitioning creditor should be regarded as someone who has submitted itself to the jurisdiction , for the purposes of the third core requirement .
Kirkaldy were a company whose main business was blasting and painting of vessels ; they wished to expand their business in south-west England by purchasing their own dry dock and setting it up in Portland , Dorset in competition with ship repair and maintenance companies in Southampton .
When it was scratched on 22 July 1997 by Mr. Walker of the Coffey Syndicate and Mr. Shrimpton of the Cox Syndicate it was contemplated that the vessel would be towed first to Southampton for work to be done on her and later to Portland .
In fact plans changed with the result that the vessel was towed direct from Sweden to Portland but that was only decided after 22 July 1997 .
-LSB- The part between the parenthetical dashes was added by Mr. Walker in his pen ; the rest of the clause was in type -RSB- Underwriters defence to the claim is that Mr. Peter Curtis -LRB- to give him his accurate spelling -RRB- performed neither a towage survey nor a condition survey and that the contract of insurance came to an end at latest when the vessel sailed .
I heard evidence of fact on behalf of the Plaintiffs from Mr. David Figgins , the managing director of and majority shareholder in Kirkaldy , the owning company , from two gentlemen whose services he used for the purpose of deciding whether to buy the Dry Dock , Mr. Alan Vincent and Mr. David Bailey .
Mr. Vincent was a friend and Mr. Bailey , an employee , was a marine electrical engineer and more knowledgeable than Mr. Figgins about technical matters to do with ships and docks .
I also heard from Mr. Nother who rode on the tow between Sweden and Portland and from Mr. Curtis , the surveyor nominated in the insurance contract .
For the defence , I heard from Mr. Walker and Mr. Shrimpton , and also Mr. Tate , Mr. Walker \ 's deputy on the underwriting box .
I had marine engineering expert evidence from Mr. Hart of Aquarius International Consultants for the Plaintiff and Mr. Waite of the Salvage association for the Defendants ; I also heard expert underwriting evidence from Mr. Richard Outhwaite and Mr Geoffrey Luben .
Once Mr. Figgins decided he would like his company to acquire a dry dock , he went to look at two available dry docks , one in Copenhagen and the other -LRB- the one he eventually bought -RRB- at Falkenburg near Gothenburg in Sweden .
There were some holes in the safety deck but not -LRB- through Inbro Citygate Insurance Brokers Ltd. -RRB- to procure insurance with the Royal Insurance group did not bear fruit ; he then obtained an introduction -LRB- through personnel at TSA Tugs Ltd. -RRB- to Mr. Richard Ellis of Everard Insurance Brokers Ltd. .
Mr. Ellis then telephoned Mr. Curtis and asked if he would inspect the dock to approve it for towage to England .
Mr. Ellis then faxed Mr. Curtis on 18 July 1997 in these terms : - Further to our telephone conversation on the afternoon of 16th July , I confirm that I have been instructed by Mr. David Figgins , Managing Director of J Kirkaldy & Sons , to place insurance on the above and that you are his nominated Surveyor to carry out the Underwriters required Towage Approval Survey and Condition Survey .
Mr. Curtis flew out to Falkenburg with Mr. David Bailey on 28 July and inspected the dock on 29 July and for a short while on 30 July before flying home .
Mr Curtis then began his inspection ; sometimes Mr. Bailey was with him while at other times Mr. Bailey was looking round by himself .
He then returned from Sweden to the United Kingdom on 30 July 1 997 together with Mr. Bailey .
He was satisfied that his recommendations had been complied with and he returned to the United Kingdom together with Mr. Figgins and Mr. Bailey who had both arrived in Sweden to see the tug set off with the dry dock in tow .
Mr. Curtis drew up a report of his inspection of the dry dock and dating it 11 August 1997 , sent it to Everards under cover a fax sheet of 13 August entitled `` Re Towage of Floating Dry-dock Sweden to Portland -LRB- Dorset -RRB- '' .
Mr. Walker was away on holiday but his deputy Mr. Tate read Mr. Curtis \ 's report at Mr. Pike \ 's request and , then , also at Mr. Pike \ 's request , signed the Everard \ 's fax , `` Noted and Agreed '' .
Mr. Marshall and Mr. Waite surveyed the dock at various stages between 3rd March and 22nd June on behalf of underwriters and they made various reports .
The reports of Mr. Waite and Mr. Marshall of the Salvage Association on the state of the dock at the time of the sinking were not seriously disputed .
The importance of this is that underwriters argued that these defects were present in Sweden , were not noticed or commented on by Mr. Curtis and would have been revealed if a condition survey had been carried out .
As far as the matrix of the contract is concerned , I find that both Mr. Ellis of Everard \ 's and Mr. Suckling of Swire Blanch -LRB- the Lloyd \ 's brokers -RRB- were acting on behalf of the assured in the usual way in their dealings with Mr. Walker of the Coffey Syndicate and Mr. Shrimpton of the Cox Syndicate .
He submitted that all these view were reasonable and possible , that Mr. Curtis had adopted the first construction as correct -LRB- with Owners \ ' expert Mr. Hart adopting the second and Insurers \ ' expert Mr. Waite adopting the third -RRB- , that the clause was ambiguous and that the ambiguity should be resolved against the insurer and the first possible construction was the correct one for this case .
It is true that the terms of Mr. Ellis \ 's written fax of 18th July instructed Mr. Curtis to `` carry out the Underwriters required Towage Approval Survey and Condition Survey '' .
But Mr. Curtis gave evidence that in prior telephone conversations Mr. Ellis had talked only of a Towage Approval Survey .
It is also the case that the heading of Mr. Ellis \ 's fax read : `` J. Kirkaldy & Sons - Towage of Floating Drydock From Sweden to Southampton Water '' thus giving sole emphasis to the towage aspect of the matter .
There must be a true ambiguity before one can resort to the rule ; it would be wrong to create an ambiguity in order to resort to the rule , see Cole v Accident Insurance -LRB- 1889 -RRB- 5 TLR 736 , 737 per Lindley and Bowen L.JJ .
It was also pointed out that the surveyor in Sweden could not know anything about the conditions under which the dry dock would have to operate at Portland .
Finally it was said that insurers were content to accept the risk of why the dry dock while in Sweden without a condition survey -LRB- which was only required prior to sailing and there was , therefore , no reason why the dry dock while in Sweden without a condition survey -LRB- which was only required prior to sailing -RRB- and there was , therefore , no reason why they should not be prepared to accept the risk of the dry dock while in Portland likewise without a condition survey done for that purpose but only done for the purpose of the towage .
This is not a convincing argument since the parties all thought that the dock would not be operating as a dry dock while in Sweden and would only be there for a short time -LRB- during survey and compliance with any recommendations -RRB- before sailing to England .
and Brown v G10 Insurance -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Lloyd \ 's I & R Reports 201 , 209 per Chadwick L.J .
As Lord Goff of Chieveley said in The Good Luck -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 A.C. 233 , 263A `` fulfilment of the warranty is a condition precedent to the liability of the insurer .
Mr. Reeder alleged that the towage approval survey was nevertheless defective because Mr. Curtis failed to do any testing for strength which was an essential part of a proper towage approval survey .
On this I had the expert evidence of Mr. Hart for the Owners and Mr. Waite of the Salvage Association for the insurers .
Mr. Curtis did consider the wave strengths likely to be encountered in an August crossing of the North Sea but did not do any theoretical calculations .
Mr. Reeder also submitted that Mr. Curtis never did a survey which would establish that the dry dock had sufficient strength in fact , because he did not enter a sufficient number of tanks and inspect in each tank .
If , therefore , Mr. Reeder \ 's test were the right test in law I would conclude in this case that , in the light of Mr. Curtis \ 's ability to enter and examine only the port side wing tanks , stress calculations were essential and that a failure to do such calculations was a failure to do an essential part of a towage approval survey .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- Waiver/Estoppel Mr. Teare submitted that if no condition survey had been performed with the result that the contract of insurance was discharged on sailing , the contract came back into effect as a result of Mr. Tate \ 's noting and agreeing of Mr. Curtis \ 's report on 14 August while Mr. Walker was away on holiday .
As I have already indicated Mr. Walker did not know the position until about 15 December when either he or Mr. Tate telephoned Mr. Curtis and asked for a copy of the Condition Survey and Mr. Curtis said he had not done one .
The mere fact that Mr. Tate read Mr. Curtis \ 's Towage Approval Survey and wrote `` Noted & agreed '' on Everard \ 's fax beneath Everard \ 's words : - `` We attach for your records , copy of fax from surveyor re towage approval .
Of course Mr. Curtis only examined the dry dock , in any event , after the insurance contract had been concluded and Mr. Reeder accepted that he could only rely on matters shown to Mr. Figgins at the time when the contract was made .
Justice Teare : In this case the Defendant seeks a stay of the proceedings commenced against it in this jurisdiction by the Claimant on the grounds that Singapore is the forum conveniens for the determination of the dispute between the parties .
\ r \ n The Claimant , Deutsche Bank AG London Branch , -LRB- `` DB '' -RRB- commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court against the Defendant , CIMB Bank Berhad , -LRB- `` CIMB '' -RRB- a Malaysian bank with a branch in London , seeking the sum of US$ 9,959,452.57 , being the principal sum which CIMB is said to be liable to reimburse DB following DB \ 's payment of such sum under letters of credit governed by UCP 600 , together with interest .
The letters of credit had been issued by CIMB and DB had , pursuant to the authority of CIMB , confirmed those letters of credit .
DB has expressed forensic -LRB- and perhaps genuine -RRB- disappointment that CIMB has not only refused to indemnify it in respect of the sums paid under the letters of credit but has also sought a stay of DB \ 's action .
\ r \ n This Application was heard on a Friday afternoon on a busy applications day in the Commercial Court .
That is in keeping with the guidance of Lord Neuberger in VTB Capital v Nutriek International Corporation -LSB- 2013 -RSB- 2 AC 337 at paragraph 82 that applications of this nature `` should not involve masses of documents , long witness statements , detailed analysis of the issues and long argument '' .
I do so with the assistance of a chronology prepared by Mr. Fletcher , counsel for CIMB , and the evidence filed on this Application .
\ r \ n By an agreement dated 19 November 2013 -LRB- `` the Facility Letter '' -RRB- CIMB agreed to provide banking facilities to its customer Cashcot Industries Pte .
Ltd. , -LRB- `` Cashcot '' -RRB- a trading company based in Singapore , in order to finance the purchase of goods by Cashcot using , in particular , letters of credit .
CIMB \ 's standard terms and conditions provided , at paragraph 8 , for a General Indemnity in these terms : \ r \ n `` As a separate and independent obligation , the relevant Obligor , shall fully indemnify the Bank from and against any expense , loss , damage or liability -LRB- as to the amount of which certificate from the Bank shall , in the absence of manifest error , be conclusive -RRB- which the Bank may incur or suffer \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85.by issuing or establishing a L/C at an Obligor \ 's request or otherwise in connection with the Facilities \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 \ xc2 \ x85 .
Between 3 September 2015 and 14 October 2015 CIMB opened 10 letters of credit at the request of Cashcot in favour of Global Tradinglinks Limited of Hong Kong -LRB- `` Global '' -RRB- to finance the purchase by Cashcot of Indian cotton .
The requisite documents were to be presented at the premises of DB in London who was authorised by CIMB to add its confirmation to the letters of credit at the beneficiary \ 's request .
The letters of credit were subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 600 -LRB- 2007 revision -RRB- .
Global does business internationally but has all of its central functions including management , credit and operations in London .
\ r \ n CIMB had security in respect of its liability under the letters of credit pursuant to the assignment by Cashcot of export letters of credit issued by Chinese banks at the request of Cashcot \ 's buyers in respect of which Cashcot were beneficiaries .
By reason of the export letters of credit having expired CIMB is no longer able to obtain payment under the same .
After the documents under the letters of credit had been presented to DB between 22 and 26 February 2016 DB presented the documents to CIMB and made calls for payment .
Between 26 February and 1 March 2016 CIMB notified DB of certain suggested discrepancies in the documents .
On 7 March 2016 DB advised CIMB that Global had informed DB that Cashcot had accepted all the suggested discrepancies .
But on the same day CIMB received an email from Cashcot saying that the discrepancies were not accepted .
CIMB rejected the presentation of documents and refused to reimburse DB in respect of the letters of credit .
\ r \ n On 11 July 2016 CIMB commenced proceedings against Cashcot in Singapore seeking a declaration that CIMB is entitled to an indemnity pursuant to the Facility Letter and the payment of certain sums into an escrow account again pursuant to the Facility Letter .
\ r \ n On 30 August 2016 CIMB commenced proceedings in Singapore against Bhadresh Trading Corporation Ltd. of India who had issued two guarantees of Cashcot \ 's obligations under the Facility Letter .
\ r \ n On 14 October 2016 CIMB obtained from the Singapore court two freezing orders against Cashcot and Bhadrash .
\ r \ n On 25 October 2016 DB commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court in this jurisdiction seeking reimbursement from CIMB of the sums it had paid to Global under the letters of credit .
\ r \ n On 7 November 2016 Cashcot was wound up pursuant to an order of the Singapore Court .
\ r \ n On 25 November 2016 CIMB issued its application for a stay of the English proceedings .
\ r \ n On 9 December 2016 CIMB issued a third set of proceedings in Singapore against Bhadresh , Global and DB -LRB- which has a branch in Singapore -RRB- .
In those proceedings CIMB alleges that Bhadresh , Global and Cashcot conspired to defraud CIMB .
In paragraph 42 of the statement of claim it is alleged that the sale of the cargo to Global and an onward sale of the cargo by Global to Cashcot were sham transactions for the purpose of obtaining payment under the letters of credit at the expense , inter alia , of CIMB .
However , CIMB has joined DB to the proceedings and seeks a declaration that it is not liable to pay DB under the letters of credit because -LRB- a -RRB- the documents were non-compliant and -LRB- b -RRB- CIMB is not liable to pay `` due to the existence of the fraud '' .
The particulars of fraud alleged are that Bhadresh , Global and Cashcot `` conspired to defraud inter alia -LSB- CIMB -RSB- using the Tendered Documents .
This could have been phrased more clearly but I accept that the fraud relied upon is not only the use of doctored or forged documents but also the creation of sham transactions for the purpose of defrauding inter alia CIMB .
\ r \ n In order to obtain a stay of the English proceedings CIMB must show that Singapore is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than England for the trial of DB \ 's claim against CIMB ; see Spiliada Maritime Corp. v Cansulex Ltd. .
-LSB- 1987 -RSB- AC 460 , 475-478 .
\ r \ n The evidence of Mr. Aston , a partner in the firm of Holman Fenwick Willan who act for CIMB , is that the only connecting factors to England are that DB is the London Branch of a German bank and that CIMB , a Malaysian bank , has a branch office in London .
DB \ 's customer Global also appears to have a real presence in London and the documents were tendered by Global to DB in London .
However , the basis upon which it is said that Singapore is clearly and distinctly the more suitable forum is said to be -LRB- i -RRB- that continuation of the English proceedings would involve CIMB in duplicative proceedings , increasing the overall costs burden and giving rise to the risk of inconsistent findings in the two sets of proceedings and -LRB- ii -RRB- that the allegations of fraud involve witnesses and documents that are located in Singapore , India , Hong Kong and China and so very far distant from England .
-LRB- Mr. Aston also said that the proper law of the letters of credit was that of Singapore , but Mr. Griffiths of DB said that no point of law is involved \ xc2 \ x96 the issues being factual - but that if there is an issue of law DB \ 's claim against CIMB is governed by English law .
\ r \ n Duplicate proceedings and risk of inconsistent decisions In considering the first argument it is necessary to bear in mind that it is well established that the contractual relationship between DB as the confirming bank and CIMB as the issuing bank is separate from the relationship between CIMB and its customer .
by Brindle and Cox at para.8-030 and 8-050 .
Until CIMB sought a negative declaration against DB in Singapore on 9 December 2016 there was only one court which was required to decide the question whether CIMB was liable to indemnify DB , namely , this court .
The spectre of duplicative proceedings and inconsistent decisions as between DB and CIMB therefore only came about by reason of the Defendant \ 's decision to sue DB for a negative declaration after proceedings had already been commenced in England by DB against the Defendant .
\ r \ n However , before 9 December 2016 there was a common issue of fact in the earlier Singapore proceedings brought by CIMB against Cashcot and Bhadresh and the later English proceedings brought by DB against CIMB , namely , whether the documents were compliant or not .
It was said that there was a risk of inconsistent findings and reliance was placed on the observation of Brandon LJ .
in the El Amria -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 2 Lloyd \ 's Reports 119 that it would be `` a potential disaster from a legal point of view '' if there were separate trials in London and in Egypt of the same issues of fact -LRB- the London trial being a claim by the cargo receivers against the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and the Egyptian trial being a proposed action by the receivers against the shipowners ; see p. 128 -RRB- .
It is however to be noted that that observation was made in a case where the most important evidence from surveyors and agronomists was to be found in England .
That factor , coupled with the risk of inconsistent decisions , meant that there were strong reasons for not giving effect to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of Egypt .
In the present case it can not be said that the evidence necessary to decide whether the documents were compliant is to be found in Singapore .
That issue can be decided , possibly with the assistance of expert evidence , in either London or Singapore .
The risk of inconsistent decisions and the duplication of costs on that issue does not point to Singapore being the more appropriate forum .
\ r \ n Further , it was submitted on behalf of DB that having regard to the express obligation in clause 8 of the terms and conditions of the Facility Letter that Cashcot indemnify CIMB the Singapore court will not have to consider the question of documentary compliance in circumstances where the English court has decided that the documents were compliant with the result that CIMB is liable to indemnify DB .
\ r \ n Mr. Fulton , for DB , submitted that a judgment of the English court holding CIMB liable to indemnify DB would enable CIMB to seek an indemnity from Cashcot on the basis that such judgment was `` an expense , loss , damage or liability '' which DB had suffered as a consequence of `` issuing or establishing a L/C at an Obligor \ 's requestor otherwise in connection with the Facilities .
Indeed , it is to be noted that in the Singapore proceedings commenced against Cashcot CIMB sought a declaration that Cashcot indemnify it in respect of `` any expense , loss damage or liability which -LSB- CIMB -RSB- may incur or suffer under any of the Letters of Credit issued by -LSB- CIMB -RSB- pursuant to the Facility Letter .
\ r \ n Mr. Fletcher , for the Defendant , submitted that clause 8 would not assist CIMB without a finding by the Singapore court that the documents were in fact compliant .
Reliance was placed upon the discussion in The Modern Law of Guarantee English Edition by Courtney , Phillips and O \ ` Donovan 3 rd ed .
at paragraphs 5-140 \ xc2 \ x96 144 and Rust Consulting Limited v PB Limited -LSB- 2010 -RSB- EWHC 3243 -LRB- TCC -RRB- at paragraphs 39-45 per Akenhead J .
However , Mr. Fletcher did not refer to the application of that principle of construction in the context of letters of credit and in particular in the context of a clause whereby a bank \ 's customer agreed to indemnify the bank in respect of a liability arising out of the issue of a letter of credit at the request of the customer .
Mr. Fulton submitted that in the context of letters of credit the natural construction of clause 8 is that it extends to and includes a liability established by a judgment as between the issuing and the confirming bank .
\ r \ n It would not be appropriate for this court to seek to determine this issue of construction because it a question to be decided in the litigation between the Defendant and its customer in Singapore .
A similar argument as to the true construction of the Guarantee given by Bhadresh -LRB- in particular clauses 1 -LRB- iii -RRB- and 31 -RRB- will have to be decided in Singapore .
\ r \ n The location of the evidence relating to the fraud allegation Mr. Fletcher told me that CIMB intends , in the English proceedings , to allege not merely that the tendered documents were forged -LRB- and , I assume , that such fraud was known to DB at the material time -RRB- but also that the letters of credit were issued as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations and so are liable to be rescinded or avoided .
He submitted that if those allegations are made out CIMB would not be liable to indemnify DB and in that regard relied upon Solo Industries UK Ltd. v Canara Bank -LRB- CA -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 1800 .
Since the evidence establishing the suggested fraud was located in or near Singapore -LRB- and not in or near London -RRB- Singapore was clearly and distinctly a more appropriate forum than London .
That depends upon what was apparent to the Bank from the documents themselves and from such other information as was available to DB at the material time .
That evidence is in London .
The court in Singapore is no better placed to determine that question than is the English court .
Second , with regard to the question whether the letters of credit were issued as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations the evidence with regard to that allegation may be found in or near to Singapore -LRB- and not in or near to London -RRB- but no allegation of fraud is made against DB and since the contractual relationship between DB and CIMB is separate and distinct from the contractual relationship between CIMB and Cashcot and from the contractual relationship between CIMB and Bhadresh , which latter relationships are alleged to have been procured by fraud , there is no basis , as it seems to me , upon which CIMB \ 's liability as issuing bank to indemnify DB as confirming bank can be challenged upon the grounds of fraud .
The fact that CIMB may be able to avoid its contractual relationships with Cashcot and Bhadresh on account of their fraud does not provide CIMB with a defence to DB \ 's claim against it .
There is no suggestion that CIMB rescinded or avoided the contractual relationship between it and DB before DB accepted the documents as compliant and paid Global -LRB- or before such payment was deemed to have been made .
\ r \ n Conclusion I have reached the conclusion , having considered counsel \ 's submissions , that CIMB has not established that Singapore is clearly and distinctly the more appropriate court to determine DB \ 's claim against CIMB .
There is a risk of inconsistent decisions on the question whether the documents were compliant but in circumstances where the documents can be considered by either this court or the Singapore court and the evidence can not be said to be more readily available in Singapore such risk does not make Singapore clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum .
Similarly , the allegation that the tendered documents were forged to the knowledge of DB when they accepted them as compliant can be considered by either court and the evidence can not be said to be more readily available in Singapore .
The allegation that the letters of credit were issued by CIMB as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations will involve evidence which is likely to be more readily available in Singapore than in London .
But such allegation can not provide CIMB with a defence to the claim brought against it by DB .
\ r \ n It was argued that the Singapore proceedings were `` significantly further advanced than the English proceedings '' and therefore that it is most appropriate that DB \ 's claim be considered by the Singapore court rather than by this court .
This probably means that more has been done in Singapore than in this jurisdiction but I am not persuaded that the Singaporean proceedings are `` significantly further advanced '' .
It is also said that if CIMB has to litigate in both jurisdictions that will involve duplication of cost and effort .
Those matters do not show that Singapore would be clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum than London .
\ r \ n Finally , it was argued that Singapore is the only forum which can give a single decision binding on all relevant parties .
It is true that all relevant parties are involved in the Singapore proceedings but CIMB could join Bhadresh and Global to the English proceedings as Part 20 defendants .
There might be a problem with Cashcot since it has been wound up ; but then the winding up must equally affect its continued involvement in the Singapore proceedings .
